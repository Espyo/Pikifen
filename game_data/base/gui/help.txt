	gameplay_basics{
		Controlling leaders;You take control of a leader, and your job is to order your Pikmin to do tasks. Organization, planning, and multitasking are essential to make the most out of your time!;help/leader
		Calling idle Pikmin;You can call an idle Pikmin to your group by whistling it or bumping against it. Afterwards, it will start following you.;help/whistling
		Throwing;Throw a Pikmin in your group towards a task or wildlife, in order to have it work on it or start attacking.;help/throwing_pikmin
		Idle Pikmin habits;Idle Pikmin have a glow to them. When idle, they will also work on nearby things on their own.;help/idle_pikmin
		Making Pikmin idle;Throwing a Pikmin at an empty spot will leave it idling where it lands. It's also possible to dismiss them all directly.;help/idle_pikmin
		Onion;Pikmin live in nests called Onions. When under an Onion, you can store Pikmin inside or call them out.;help/onion
		Growing Pikmin;Pikmin can carry things to the Onion. After delivery, the Onion will create new Pikmin!;help/carrying
		Pikmin types;Different Pikmin types have different strengths and weaknesses. Always try to use the right Pikmin for the job!;help/pikmin_types
		Swapping Pikmin types;You will only throw Pikmin of the current standby type. Change the standby type to throw other Pikmin.;help/pikmin_types_hud
		Carrying target;Some items need multiple Pikmin to carry. The type of Pikmin receiving the object at the Onion matches the majority of carriers.;help/carrying_rules
		Obstacles;Some obstacles will require multiple Pikmin to work together to clear them, sometimes by combining their strengths, sometimes their weights.;help/obstacle
		Leader swapping;You can swap control between leaders. Try leaving different leaders with different groups of Pikmin so you can multitask.;help/leaders_hud
		Throwing teammates;Other leaders can also join your group, or be thrown like Pikmin. Use this to reach new places.;help/throwing_leaders
		Pikmin deaths;Pikmin can be eaten, burned up, or die in other ways. Their strength lies in their numbers, however!;help/combat
		Enemy combat;Learn how each enemy works, and how best to attack them! Try aiming for their weak spots.;help/weak_spots
		Pikmin counters;Use the counters at the bottom of the HUD to keep an eye on Pikmin counts. These only count Pikmin, though the amount ready at standby can also refer to leaders if you have any selected.;help/pikmin_counters
		Radar;Keep an eye out on your Pikmin and objectives with the radar in the pause menu.;help/radar

	advanced_gameplay{
		Balancing Pikmin amounts;The more Pikmin doing something together, the more efficient and effective they will be. But too many in one place means things like shortcut opening or reinforcement growing aren't getting done. Plan carefully!;help/pikmin_balance
		Saving Pikmin;If your Pikmin are in trouble, whistling them is generally a good catch-all way of saving them!;help/saving_pikmin
		Maturity;Pikmin with a leaf on their head walk and carry objects slowly. Bud Pikmin are a bit faster, and flower Pikmin are the fastest. To increase a Pikmin's maturity, let it stay underground for a while before plucking, or feed it nectar.;help/maturity
		Sprays;Use sprays to help you out. Spicy sprays speed your Pikmin up, and bitter sprays freeze enemies!;help/sprays
		Carrying path;Pikmin take the shortest path available to their destination. If a barrier is blocking a shorter path, consider taking it down.;help/paths
		Stuck on a path;Are Pikmin stuck moving in a circle? The path is probably blocked and they are waiting for it to be cleared!;help/carrying
		Excess suffering;Pikmin that have been recently burned, poisoned, etc. will survive for less time if it happens again! This "health" value eventually returns to normal over time.;help/saving_pikmin
		Getting up;If a Pikmin got knocked back, is lying on the floor, and about to be attacked, whistle it to make it get up faster.;help/getting_up
		Onion menu;Whether you're ordering Pikmin to go in the Onion or calling some out, try holding down the button on-screen to choose your numbers faster.;help/onion_menu
		Go Here;Using the radar, command a leader to go somewhere and then change to a different leader. While they're busy walking, you're busy working!;help/radar

		Swarm;Swarm your group of Pikmin towards the cursor with \k swarm_cursor \k, or in a specific direction with \k swarm_up \k \k swarm_left \k \k swarm_down \k \k swarm_right \k. They'll start working on whatever they touch.;help/swarming
		Swap leader;Change to a different leader in the area with \k next_leader \k.;help/leaders_hud
		Dismiss;Dismiss your group with \k dismiss \k. If you're swarming, they will be dismissed in that direction.;help/dismissing

		Punch;When you have no Pikmin in your group, throw a punch with \k throw \k.;help/punching
		Lie down;Lie down with \k lie_down \k. Nearby Pikmin will pick you up and carry you to an Onion, so use this opportunity to swap to a new leader and do something else.;help/lying_down
		Mouse cursor;When playing with a mouse, the leader's cursor follows your own mouse cursor. But regardless of control scheme, the leader cursor's range is limited, so pay attention to where the leader is really aiming!;help/mouse_cursor
		Releasing held Pikmin;To drop a held Pikmin without throwing it, keep \k throw \k held, and press \k whistle \k.;help/throwing_pikmin

	objects{
		Pellet;Pellets are like food for Pikmin, making them good sources for more Pikmin. The number on them specifies their weight. Try matching the receiving Pikmin type with their color!;help/pellet
		Nectar;Pikmin that drink nectar will go up in maturity. The more mature a Pikmin, the faster it'll move.;help/nectar
		Egg;Eggs usually have nectar inside, but if you're lucky, they can drop some spray drops.;help/egg
		Bomb rock;Bomb rocks can be picked up by any Pikmin. Throw a Pikmin with one to drop it and start its fuse. If a bomb rock Pikmin gets bit by an enemy, it'll snatch the bomb instead!;help/bomb_rock
		Reinforced wall;Reinforced walls cannot be destroyed by Pikmin directly. Try some explosive force instead.;help/reinforced_wall
		Fire geyser;There are geysers that shoot out fire from beneath the earth. Red Pikmin can resist the heat, though if you time your attacks, you can destroy it with any Pikmin.;help/fire_geyser
		Electrical wire;Exposed wires will sometimes cause sparks. Afterwards, they'll form a fatal electrical arc! You can either time your attacks, or just use Yellow Pikmin to be safe.;help/electrical_wire
		Clog;Stones and debris can build up on top of a lake's draining spot. When cleared, the water around it will drain out. Since it's on water, Blue Pikmin should be tasked with destroying it.;help/clog
		Gas pipe;Pipes coming out from the floor that continuously spew gas can prove deadly to most Pikmin. White Pikmin can destroy them, however.;help/gas_pipe
		Crystal;If you see a lump of crystal, or anything that looks glass-like, try throwing Rock Pikmin at it to break it!;help/crystal
		Flukeweed;Flukeweeds look like spiraling plants, and usually hide something underneath their roots. Winged Pikmin can pull these plants out.;help/flukeweed
		Bamboo gate;Bamboo gates have handles at the top, and can be lifted into the air by Winged Pikmin.;help/bamboo_gate
