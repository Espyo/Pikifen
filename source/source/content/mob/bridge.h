/**
 * @brief A bridge mob.
 *
 * Bridges on the engine are made up of two parts:
 * the mob itself, which Pikmin damage, and a series of components.
 * Each component is a mob that other mobs can walk on top of, serving
 * either as the floor of the bridge, or one of the rails.
 * Every time the bridge expands, it is considered that a new chunk has
 * been added, which may either generate new components, or stretch the
 * existing ones.
