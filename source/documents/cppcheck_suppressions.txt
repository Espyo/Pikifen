//Pikifen uses C-style casts a lot, and I've never had a problem with them.
cstyleCast

//IMO, using an STL algorithm is often over-engineering and more verbose than just writing the code directly.
useStlAlgorithm

//Not really very important.
noCopyConstructor
noOperatorEq

//Inside of a function the function code should kinda do what it wants. consts are a good way to promise to the OUTSIDE that the data won't be touched, but on the inside, who cares?
constVariablePointer
constVariableReference

//I like this because if, say, the code in a switch-case changes and a return is removed, we don't accidentally introduce a fallthrough.

//The FSMs use callbacks of all sorts, so some may need the parameters to not be const.
constParameterCallback

//Like the FSMs, action runners and loaders are callbacks of all sorts, so some may need the parameters to not be const.

//Ever since I upgraded from 2.7 to 2.14 it started complaining about standard include headers. Checking online, this is a pretty common problem.
missingIncludeSystem

//Also since the upgrade from 2.7 to 2.14, this started appearing. It's pretty useless.
