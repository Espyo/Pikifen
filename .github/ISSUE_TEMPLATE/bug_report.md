# Before you start, please read the included manual's troubleshooting page! Then, fill in the text in brackets:

## Description
<A description of the bug. If it's not painfully obvious, you should also explain what exactly is wrong, and what you expected to happen instead. If you have a screenshot or a video of the bug in action, that'd be very appreciated.>

## To reproduce
<I'll want to do the same things you did in order to face the bug myself, so it's important that you find and report a way to reproduce the bug. If you can't, please list off what you were doing in the moments leading up to the bug happening.>

## Error log
<Especially important for crashes, you should share the contents of your error log file. A screenshot may have also been created in the `user_data` folder, so share that too.>

## Content modifications
<If you're using some content pack or changed the base content, please let me know what you have done, since the problem might depend on those changes.>

## Extra notes
<Any extra notes you feel are relevant to helping me figure out the issue. Some ideas:
* You should always be using the latest official version of _Pikifen_, but in case you're using an older version or on a git commit farther ahead than the latest official version, please specify that information too.
* If your problem is related to something system-wide, like the game window, graphic or audio corruptions, file mishaps, etc., please specify your operating system.>
