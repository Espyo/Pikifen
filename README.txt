1) Overview
===============
    Pikifen (formerly known as the Pikmin fangame engine) is an engine capable of creating and playing Pikmin fan content. It is an open-source engine, currently under development, and can handle gameplay similar to the Pikmin games, in that it allows leaders to whistle and throw Pikmin, allows Pikmin to carry objects, etc. Although the idea is for fans to create their own content (enemies, areas, etc.) so the engine can read it and turn it into something playable, the project also comes with some pre-packaged content, which makes it possible for people who download it to experiment with its features right away.
    
    The reason for its creation was to make it possible for fans to make their own Pikmin fan content and to be able to play on it, by requiring only assets and data, while the engine itself handles all of the more complicated parts like the physics and artificial intelligence. Its most recent version, in alpha, is available for download. The engine can run on Windows, Linux, and Mac.
    
    The game created by the engine has a 2-dimensional look, and is seen from an orthographic top-down view, although it is still a 3-dimensional game, in that height and gravity exist. The mechanics attempt to mimic those found in the Pikmin games, although not always to the same degree. They can be different because it's easier that way, it's better for the engine's flexibility, or because it's not possible to fully replicate what happens in the canon games.
    Players can only currently select what area to play on, after which they are taken to that area and are free to play around with no objective. Win conditions, failure conditions, and progression will be added in the future.
    Being a PC game, it is played using a keyboard, mouse, and/or a gamepad. Since it is still in development, some features may be fully implemented, missing entirely, or working incorrectly.

3) Get the latest version
===============
    Windows
        The latest version available for download for Windows is shown at the top of the GitHub releases page: https://github.com/Espyo/Pikifen/releases The download is a compressed (zipped) file, which should be simple to extract. Just unzip everything onto a folder, and double-click Pikifen.exe from the folder to start running.
        Alternatively, you can download the source code for the master branch and compile it to get the most up-to-date features; compilation instructions can be found in the included manual.
    Linux and Mac
        In order to play on Linux or Mac, you can either build it from the source code, or run the Windows executable under Wine. It works fairly well with Wine, though if you run into troubles, check the included manual's troubleshooting section.
        A simple tutorial on how to compile the engine can be found in the included manual.
    Upgrading from an older version
        If you are upgrading from an older version of the engine, you should extract it into a new folder and use that one instead. If you do this, remember to copy over the "User_data" folder from the previous version, if you care about your settings and personal backups, as well as your custom-made content if you care about it. Remember to also follow any instructions noted in the changelog, inside the included manual.
        If you just extract the new version into the same folder as the old one, you risk having files you care about be replaced, or keeping old files that the new version doesn't use and end up wasting space.

4) Playing and making
===============
    To play, just pick an area and start playing!
    To make content for the engine, just edit the image, sound, or text files in the "Game_data" folder. Some things can also be edited using the built-in editors.
    This project is still under construction, so some things to be incomplete!
    For more detailed information, including tutorials, please check the included manual.
