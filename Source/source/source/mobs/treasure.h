/* ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * "Treasure" is the catch-all term for the
 * main collectible in the game.
 * Without it, you cannot complete the game,
 * and normally you need to collect them all;
 * collecting specific ones makes the story
 * move forward.
 * These are the ship parts in P, treasures
 * in P2, and fruits in P3.
 * They're called treasures because I had to
 * settle with some familiar name, and all
 * three types of major collectibles
 * in the canon games are very valuable, so...
 * Without the ship parts, Olimar would die,
 * without the treasures, the Freight would
 * go bankrupt (plus the treasures are worth
 * a monetary amount in and of themselves),
 * and without the fruits, Koppai would starve.
