 * Functions related to offseting edges, for the purposes of creating
 * wall shadow, ledge smoothing, or water foam effects.
 * These effects are obtained by drawing some geometry that follows
 * neighboring edges around, but is offset forward (or backward).
 * Some calculations and trickery are needed when neighboring edges meet at
 * acute or obtuse angles.
