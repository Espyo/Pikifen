 * === FILE DESCRIPTION ===
 * Header for audio-related things.
 *
 * The audio manager is the main engine behind everything audio in Pikifen.
 * Sound effects can only come from sound sources. This way, it's possible
 * for a sound source to set its position in the game world every frame for
 * the sake of panning and volume, for it to keep emitting a certain sound until
 * told to stop, etc.
 * So when something in the engine needs to play a sound effect, it asks the
 * audio manager to create a sound source. Sometime later, either by the
 * audio manager itself or by manual request from whatever saved the source,
 * the source can then be destroyed (via audio manager).
 * The existence of a centralized audio manager helps ensure we don't have the
 * same sound effect play back too many times in a jarring way, helps makes
 * sounds fade out smoothly, helps make panning and volume simpler, and more.
