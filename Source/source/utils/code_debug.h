/* ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Memory allocation and memory leak debug.
 * To activate:
 *   1. Define CODE_DEBUG_NEW.
 *   2. Include this header file in all cpp files.
 *   3. Do a global project replace of "new" to "code_debug_new",
 *     and "delete" to "code_debug_delete". Enable case-sensitivity and
 *     "whole word" matching, and don't replace anything in this
 *     header file or the cpp file.
 *   4. At some point in your code, start recording allocations by doing
 *     "code_debug_new_recording = true;"
 *   5. Place a breakpoint when you want to stop recording and examine
 *     memory leaks, by watching the code_debug_new_allocs vector's contents.
 * With this tool on, all memory allocations and freeings will be recorded.
 * This only applies to operations in the project's code
 * (hence the find-and-replace). This helps in debugging memory leaks in
 * two instances of the same state of execution.
 * For instance, you enter the main menu, start recording, enter a different
 * menu, and return to the main menu. Everything that got allocated since
 * recording should've been freed by now since the program is in the same
 * state it was before (the main menu). With this tool, it is possible to see
 * what addresses were allocated, but not freed.
 * The only information that is given is the memory address (whose content can
 * be inspected if you paused execution with a breakpoint), and the file + line
 * the allocation was made in.
 * Compared to the likes of memcheck, this is faster, and useful in that it
 * reports lines from the project's code exclusively,
 * making it easier to understand.
 * Based on http://wyw.dcweb.cn/leakage.htm
