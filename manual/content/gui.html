    <p>All menus and HUDs (heads-up displays) in <i>Pikifen</i> can be customized. Most of them only allow you to change the position and size of the different items, but some may allow for more in-depth customizations. Each menu or HUD has a GUI (graphical user interface), and each GUI definition is a piece of <a href="making.html#content">content</a>, so you should know how content works in the engine in general before starting. Each one has its own <a href="making.html#data-file">data file</a>, located in <code>game_data/&lt;<a href="making.html#packs">pack</a>&gt;/gui</code>.</p>

    <p>To change the position and size of elements, you can just use the GUI editor, accessible from the main menu. To change other things, you will need to edit the data files by hand.</p>
    
    <p>This page explains how the editor works, as well as list all the different menus and HUDs that can be customized.</p>
    
    <h2 id="editor">GUI editor</h2>

    <p>The GUI editor is a simple tool that allows you to change the position and size of each item in a menu/HUD.</p>

    <h3 id="opening">Opening a GUI definition file</h3>

    <dl>
      <dt><b>When you open the menu, you'll be asked what GUI to edit.</b></dt>
      <dd>You can access the GUI editor from the main menu's "make" page. Once you do, you'll be shown a list of menus and HUDs whose GUIs you can edit.</dd>

      <dt><b>The editor only knows each GUI definition's internal name, but these are usually obvious.</b></dt>
      <dd>Because the editor is made to be simple and flexible, allowing the customization of any GUI that the engine has or will have, it doesn't actually know anything about specific menus, it just knows the names of the data files inside the GUI definitions folder. So this dialog will show you the text file names, i.e. the internal names, instead of the menu or HUD names. Still, these names are pretty obvious, and if you're ever in doubt, check the <a href="#definitions">GUI definitions section</a> of this page, since that lists what each menu's file is.</dd>
    </dl>
    
    <h3 id="coordinates">Canvas and coordinates</h3>

    <dl>
      <dt><b>The left side of the editor represents the player's game window.</b></dt>
      <dd>Once you open a file, you'll see a green square in a black void in the canvas, on the left half of the editor. This square represents the player's game window, and is where all the items are positioned.</dd>

      <dt><b>GUI item positions and sizes aren't specified in pixels.</b></dt>
      <dd>You may find it weird how the green shape in the canvas is a square, since almost nobody uses a square game window. The trick with this editor, and with the way GUI item positions and sizes work, is that you don't specify exact coordinates for where they should go, or how big they should be. If you want to horizontally center a certain item on-screen, you can't just say its center's X coordinate is 512 pixels or something. While 512 pixels may look centered in your game's window, it may look completely off in the window of somebody with a different size &ndash; remember each player can set the game's window size in the options menu!</dd>

      <dt><b>Positions and sizes are measured in screen percentages.</b></dt>
      <dd>Instead of pixels, you have to specify percentages of the screen. To center something horizontally, you specify its center's X coordinate as 50%. To make it flush to the top of the screen, its Y coordinate should be 0%. To make it take up a third of the screen horizontally, its width should be 33%. And so on. So, in reality, the green square you see in the canvas is just a representation of percentages, and while it's a square here, the real game window will likely be stretched differently depending on each player's resolution. Still, the idea is for items to be placed in the portion of the screen they work best at, for items to look good together, for items to look nice when spaced evenly apart, etc., so exact pixels don't really matter.</dd>

      <dt><b>The mouse cursor's position can be seen in the status bar.</b></dt>
      <dd>As you move the mouse cursor about, you can see where it is positioned in the green square by checking the right side of the status bar, located at the bottom of the editor.</dd>
    </dl>

    <h3 id="panel">Panel</h3>

    <dl>
      <dt><b>The panel on the right lists all items.</b></dt>
      <dd>The right side of the editor has a panel that includes a list of all the items in the current GUI definition, as well as their internal names.</dd>

      <dt><b>In the list, checkboxes specify whether an item is visible.</b></dt>
      <dd>You can click on an item's checkbox in the list to make it visible or invisible. If it is invisible, it won't show up in the canvas nor in-game.</dd>

      <dt><b>Click an item in the list to select it.</b></dt>
      <dd>When you click an item (not its checkbox), you will see some information about that item appear below the list in the panel. You will also see some handles on the canvas, surrounding that item. Those handles are explained later.</dd>

      <dt><b>Edit the selected item's position or size in the widgets below the list.</b></dt>
      <dd>The numbers in the "center" and "size" widgets represent screen percentages, as explained above. If instead you would like to specify where an item's top-left corner is, or bottom-right corner, there are some widgets to adjust things that way.</dd>
    </dl>

    <h3 id="canvas">Interacting with the canvas</h3>

    <dl>
      <dt><b>Click an item's bubble in the canvas to select it.</b></dt>
      <dd>Instead of selecting an item through the panel's list, you can click on it in the canvas to select it. Doing so will also correctly select the corresponding item in the list.</dd>
      
      <dt><b>When items overlap, keep clicking to select different ones.</b></dt>
      <dd>If you click somewhere where two items overlap, the editor will select one of them. But if you click there again, it will select the other one. You can keep clicking to change which item is selected, making it a good way to find the exact item you need when you've got a lot of them in a tight space.</dd>

      <dt><b>Drag the central handle of the selected item to move it.</b></dt>
      <dd>Once an item is selected, handles appear allowing you to shape it in the canvas. This makes things much easier than tweaking numbers manually in the panel. The central handle moves the item around.</dd>

      <dt><b>Drag the other handles to resize it.</b></dt>
      <dd>The handles at the edges and corners of the selected item allow you to resize it, be it horizontally, vertically, or both. You can hold Alt to lock the center, instead of locking the opposite edge or corner.</dd>

      <dt><b>Hold Shift to disable snapping.</b></dt>
      <dd>When you move the handles, they snap to the nearest grid point. This helps you keep things aligned. If you don't want that, you can hold down the Shift key to disable snapping. You can also disable snapping by using the button in the toolbar that controls the snapping mode.</dd>
      
      <dt><b>Hold Ctrl to snap to horizontal or vertical axis.</b></dt>
      <dd>By holding Ctrl, you can move something just up or down, or just left or right.</dd>
    </dl>

    <h3 id="finishing">Putting it all together</h3>

    <dl>
      <dt><b>When you're done, save with the button in the toolbar.</b></dt>
      <dd>When you press the save button, the GUI definition gets saved to a file on the disk, and if you want, you can now quit the editor (with the button in the toolbar), go to where the relevant menu or HUD is, and check it out in action. Are things not quite what you expected? Here are some things to keep in mind:</dd>

      <dt><b>The editor can only uses an item's internal name and draw a vague shape representing it.</b></dt>
      <dd>Because each GUI item can behave in its own way, and look however it pleases, it is impossible for the GUI editor to show them in the canvas. Something like an icon in a menu might be simple, but something like the Sun Meter is composed of many individual moving parts. So you're going to have to use your imagination when using the editor. Likewise, the editor doesn't know what each GUI is doing, it just knows what items exist (and what their positions and sizes are) because that information is in the data files. So you'll have to get used to handling the internal names of items instead of something more descriptive. Though again, if you're ever unsure what an item is, check the <a href="#definitions">GUI definitions section</a> of this document.</dd>

      <dt><b>An item's size only specifies its maximum size.</b></dt>
      <dd>If you give an item a large width, but a small height, you may be surprised to find that, in-game, it doesn't look stretched out, and in fact looks pretty tiny. There is no one rule that controls what each item looks like &ndash; every single item in a menu or HUD behaves however it wants. The size properties in the GUI definition simply dictate the <i>maximum</i> width or height that the item is allowed to have. Normally, a GUI item will never be larger than the width or height you specified, though it can be smaller.</dd>

      <dt><b>GUI items can animate, including moving around.</b></dt>
      <dd>When gameplay starts, the HUD moves into view from the edges of the screen. When you pause, the menu slides into view from off-screen. A GUI's definition does not include any information about this, since that's all controlled by the engine. So don't be surprised that a GUI item can be in a position different from the one you specified &ndash; it's just moving into place! Likewise, some counters animate by growing their text whenever their number changes. This can result in them being bigger than the specified size, even if it's only temporary. If you're absolutely worried that this might make it bump into another item, remember to give the item some extra breathing room in the editor.</dd>

      <dt><b>If you want an item gone, mark it as invisible instead of placing it off-screen.</b></dt>
      <dd>While a GUI item can be partially off-screen if you want, they shouldn't be entirely off-screen. Because GUI items can animate and move during transitions, an item that is placed off-screen might come into view during these times, which can confuse the player. Plus, having these items off-screen will still make the engine waste resources on processing them, even if they're practically useless in-game. Instead, untick its checkbox in the list of items, in the panel.</dd>
    </dl>

    <h2 id="definitions">GUI definitions</h2>

    <p>Each of these sections refers to a menu/HUD, and explains what GUI definition controls it, the internal names of each item, and what properties can be changed in the GUI definition's data file. The <code>positions</code> block in a data file controls the position and size of each item in that menu/HUD, but as explained before, you're better off using the editor for these.</p>
