    <b>Piles</b> are objects that contain several <a href="mob_resource.html">resources</a> in them, that can be harvested by the Pikmin.

    <p>Examples of pile types include piles of bridge fragments, or Burgeoning Spiderworts, which have a bundle of berries.</p>

    <p>To create a new type of pile, please follow the <a href="mob_type.html">making object types tutorial</a>.</p>

    <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

    <p>Pile objects just sit there, and can be attacked by the Pikmin. Once they suffer enough damage, they give the Pikmin one of their resources. They can recharge with time, and change their look as the number of resources they have left changes.</p>

    <p>Pile type objects are hardcoded in the engine to sit there and have their health depleted, give out resources when they suffer enough damage, show how many resources they have, changed their look based on how many resources they have, and optionally disappear when they're empty.</p>

This list must be filled in order from empty to fullest. For example, in a pile of 10 resources max, if you want it to have an idling animation for when it's empty, and three more idling animations for the different amounts of resources it's holding, you'd set this to something like <code>_empty; _low; _mid; _high</code>. This would mean the <code>idling_empty</code> animation would be used when empty, <code>idling_mid</code> for when it's got 5, etc. The first will always correspond to the pile being empty, while the others are divided equally. So a pile with 20 max, split into 5 animations + empty, would change animation every 4 resources.</td>

    <h2 id="animations">Animations</h2>

    <p>A pile type needs to have the following animations. Note that for every phase specified in the <code>size_animation_suffixes</code> property, you need another set of these animations, and each set needs to end with the corresponding suffix.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><b><code>idling</code></b>: Idling; used for everything.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="script">Script</h2>

    <p>Pile types have hardcoded <a href="script.html">scripts</a>, so the only thing you can do is enhance them. You can handle the <code><a href="events_and_actions.html#on-receive-message">on_receive_message</a></code> event and check for the <code>grown_resource</code> or <code>dropped_resource</code> messages, if you need to know when a resource is grown or dropped.</p>

    <p>Some <a href="script.html#vars">script variables</a> control special behavior, like the pile's starting amount. To know which ones exist, you can go to the area editor, select a pile, and read the tooltip of each variable.</p>
