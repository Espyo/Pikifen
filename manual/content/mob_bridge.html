    <b>Bridges</b> are objects that start off as just a stub, and when Pikmin are done working on them, they form a full bridge over an obstacle that anything can walk on.

    <p>Examples of bridge types include the wooden bridge from <i>Pikmin</i>, that starts as a stub Pikmin work on and gets fully built when they are done, the red ceramic bridge from <i>Pikmin 3</i>, that starts as a stub and grows as Pikmin collect shards and drop them on the bridge, etc.</p>

    <p>To create a new type of bridge, please follow the <a href="mob_type.html">making object types tutorial</a>.</p>

    <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

    <p>The bridge object serves as something for the Pikmin to work on. As it gets damaged, it creates special objects of the built-in "Bridge component" type nearby, to serve as the floor and rails of the bridge proper. Once its health is fully depleted, it changes to a "destroyed" animation. Some bridges are built by having the Pikmin attack it (e.g. <i>Pikmin</i> wooden bridge). Others are built by having the Pikmin deliver some sort of <a href="mob_resource.html">resource</a> into the bridge (e.g. <i>Pikmin 3</i> ceramic bridge).</p>

    <h2 id="animations">Animations</h2>

    <p>A bridge type needs to have the following animations:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><b><code>idling</code></b>: Under construction, and is just idling.</li>
      <li><b><code>destroyed</code></b>: Fully built.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="script">Script</h2>

    <p>Bridge types have hardcoded <a href="script.html">scripts</a>, so the only thing you can do is enhance them.</p>

    <p>Some <a href="script.html#vars">script variables</a> control special behavior, like the number of chunks the bridge is built into. To know which ones exist, you can go to the area editor, select a bridge, and read the tooltip of each variable.</p>
