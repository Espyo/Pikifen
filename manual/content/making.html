    <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
    
    <p>You can make Pikmin types, leaders, areas, and so much more, so they can then be used in-game. The ways to make this sort of <a href="#content">content</a> vary, but are in general made to be easy and intuitive. Content like types of objects, sprays, and so on can be freely made, but new game mechanics and logic cannot; this also includes enemies, areas, etc. that make use of any new mechanic.</p>
    <p>Content, as well as most customizable things in the engine, are just standard graphics, audio, or text files &ndash; you can use your favorite programs to edit them or create new ones. Knowledge about how files and folders work in your operative system is recommended, almost a requirement. That said, some content is a bit too complex for you to edit by hand with a standard program, so instead you will want to use one of the editors inside the engine, which are specialized for the job.</p>
    <p>A good starting point is to check out the base content that can be found in the <code>game_data/base</code> folder included with the engine. From there, you can add your own spin to the content that is already there by changing the files. Or you can make new content blindly by yourself. Or copy-paste the content that already exists to serve as a basis for new things. Or check the <a href="quick_start.html">quick start guide</a> to get some pointers so you can figure out the rest for yourself. Or read any of the in-depth tutorials <a href="#tutorials">here</a> to have a more guided experience. Or enter one of the aforementioned editors and feel your way around.</p>
    <p>As long as the right content is in the right folder, and/or has the name that the other content or engine expects it to, you can just work on it, save, and at any moment start the engine and test it right away. As you make content, keep in mind that most user-made mistakes will be caught by the engine and reported in the file <code>user_data/error_log.txt</code>. You should make a point to fix these problems as soon as possible, otherwise the engine might behave erratically or even crash.</p>

    <h2 id="content">Content</h2>

    <p>If you do not know the basics of what content and packs are, please read <a href="content.html">content and packs</a>.</p>

    <dl>
      <dt><b>Every piece of content has an internal name, which is referred to by other content.</b></dt>
      <dd>When other content needs to refer to this content, it does so by using the internal name. For example, the spicy status's data refers to the spicy sparkles particles it generates as <code>spicy_sparkles</code>, since that's the internal name of that particle generator.</dd>
      <dt><b>Internal names are the file names without extension or the folder names.</b></dt>
      <dd>Whether a piece of content's internal name comes from its file name or from its folder name depends on the type of content. In the case of file names, the file proper must have an <a href="glossary.html#file-name">extension</a> but the internal name will not include it.</dd>
      <dt><b>Internal names should ideally be in lowercase and use underscores.</b></dt>
      <dd>To avoid mishaps with case sensitivity and spaces for separating arguments in different parts of the engine, internal names (and thus content file and folder names) should use lowercase letters only, use underscores instead of spaces, and avoid more "exotic" characters like symbols.</dd>
      <dt><b>Most content has a data file with some metadata.</b></dt>
      <dd>Besides things like images and sounds, all pieces of game content have a data file that contains metadata, i.e. information about what this content is, what version it is, who made it, and so on. See <a href="#content-props">here</a> for details.</dd>
      <dt><b>Content can exist in multiple packs.</b></dt>
      <dd>For more information, see <a href="#packs">here</a>.</dd>
    </dl>

    <h2 id="data-file">Data file</h2>

    <dl>
      <dt><b>Data files usually contain information about how some content or engine feature works.</b></dt>
      <dd>Using simple terms, numbers, and symbols, these files dictate the numbers and data that make the engine and its content tick.</dd>
      <dt><b>Data files are text files but following a certain format.</b></dt>
      <dd>They are actually just everyday text files, with a <a href="glossary.html#file-name">file name</a> ending in <code>.txt</code>, though the stuff inside follows a specific format. The engine reads a data file one line at a time.</dd>
      <dt><b>Each property follows the format <code>name = value</code>.</b></dt>
      <dd>The most basic type of line is a simple property and its value. The property's name comes first, followed by an equals sign, and then the value. e.g. <code>max_pikmin = 5</code>.</dd>
      <dt><b>Blocks start with the format <code>name {</code>, and end with a line with just <code>}</code>.</b></dt>
      <dd>Data files may also contain blocks, which in turn can contain properties or other blocks. A block starts with its name, followed by an opening curly brace, and ends on a line that contains solely the closing brace.</dd>
    </dl>

    <p>Here's an example:</p>
    
<pre>property = value 1
block {
    property_inside_block = value_2
    sub_block {
        property_inside_sub_block = another value
    }
}</pre>

    <dl>
      <dt><b>It is good practice to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indentation_style">indent</a> the lines inside a block.</b></dt>
      <dd>The deeper the block, the deeper the indentation. The engine ignores any spaces or tabs before the first word in the line, so add as many as you want.</dd>
      <dt><b>Use empty lines and spaces for spacing.</b></dt>
      <dd>The engine will not read empty lines, and it won't care if there's a space before or after the equals sign in a property's line, so feel free to make use of that to pad things out and make the file easier to read.</dd>
      <dt><b>Comments follow the format <code>//comment</code>.</b></dt>
      <dd>The engine will also not read lines that have two slashes before the first word. Meaning that something like <code>//This is a comment.</code> will not be read. You can use these comments to explain or label parts of the file to make it easier to understand.</dd>
    </dl>
    
    <p><b>Warning</b>: avoid Windows's "Notepad" program to edit these data files, since they usually show up broken or all in a single line. Try something like <a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org">Notepad++</a> instead.</p>

    <h3 id="data-file-properties">Property types</h3>

    <p>Throughout this manual you'll find tables listing some properties. One of the columns refers to the type of the value. Types include:</p>

    <ul class="highlight-target">
      <li id="data-file-text"><b>Text</b> Just regular text. e.g.: <code>Red Pikmin</code></li>
      <li id="data-file-number"><b>Number</b>: A number. Both positive and negative numbers work, and both <a href="glossary.html#integer">integers</a> and <a href="glossary.html#float-number">float numbers</a> are allowed.</li>
      <li id="data-file-boolean"><b>Boolean</b>: A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_data_type">Boolean</a> (or "bool") is a value that's just either true or false. So, write <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>.</li>
      <li id="data-file-point"><b>Point</b>: Two numbers, one for the X coordinate, one for the Y coordinate, separated by space.</li>
      <li id="data-file-color"><b>Color</b>: A color, represented by its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RGB_color_model">RGB</a> values. Either write it in the format <code>r g b</code>, or if you want to include alpha (opacity), <code>r g b a</code>. e.g. <code>255 128 0</code> (orange), <code>255 255 255 64</code> (transparent white). You can also write the name of a color (though only a few basic ones are known), and if you want alpha, the number afterwards. e.g. <code>cyan</code> (cyan), <code>yellow 192</code> (slightly transparent yellow).</li>
      <li id="data-file-internal-name"><b>Internal name</b>: The <a href="#content">internal name</a> of some piece of content. e.g. <code>red_bulborb</code></li>
      <li id="data-file-file-name"><b>File name</b>: A <a href="glossary.html#file-name">file name</a>. e.g. <code>grass.jpg</code></li>
      <li id="data-file-list"><b>List</b>: A list of some values, separated by a semicolon. e.g. <code>Olimar; Louie; President</code></li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2 id="content-props">Content properties</h2>

    <p>Most pieces of <a href="#content">content</a> are, or have, a <a href="#data-file">data file</a> that describes them. The following properties apply to all such files. Please check the relevant content type's page in this manual since it may mention some special considerations you can or should have about these properties.</p>

    <table class="props-t props-t-o">
      <tr>
        <td>name</td>
        <td>Proper name for the content. This is not the internal name, and is meant to be a name for the player or maker to see. e.g. "Red Pikmin", "Lava", "Ultra-Spicy Spray", etc.</td>

        <td></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>tags</td>
        <td>A list of tags, separated by semicolon, e.g. <code>Colorful; Advanced; Gimmick</code>. What exactly this entails, and what tags are recommended varies with the type of content. The idea is that when a player or a maker want to find some content that fits their needs, they can search for these tags.</td>
        <td>List</td>
        <td></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>maker</td>
        <td>Name or nickname of the person or persons who made this content. If this content is based off of something, like a port of The Impact Site's theme song, this property still refers to who created the <i>Pikifen</i> content; credits for the original creation can be added in the <code>notes</code> property.</td>
        <td>Text</td>
        <td></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>version</td>
        <td>Version name or number, e.g. <code>1.2.3</code>. It's a good idea to increase this whenever you create a new version.</td>
        <td>Text</td>

      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>engine_version</td>

The engine may use this information to port content that was made in an older version. This information is also automatically filled in for content created via one of the in-game editors.</td>
        <td>Text</td>
        <td></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>maker_notes</td>

        <td></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>

    </table>

    <h2 id="packs">Packs</h2>

    <p>If you do not know the basics of what content and packs are, please read <a href="content.html">content and packs</a>.</p>

    <dl>
      <dt><b>The base pack comes with the engine and should not be edited!</b></dt>
      <dd>The base content, that lives in <code>game_data/base</code>, is meant to contain some, well, base content; basic stuff for players to get a feel of the game and have something to play with, as well as building blocks for people who want to create their own content with. Although you're free to take a look inside or just experiment temporarily, as a general rule you shouldn't create new content inside the base pack or edit the content that's already there!</dd>
      <dt><b>You should create your own packs for the stuff you make.</b></dt>
      <dd>It's recommended to create your own pack, so that if something goes wrong with your creation or you want to share it, you won't have to wade through hundreds of files in search of what's what, and can instead focus solely on what's yours. Likewise, players will be able to just place your folder in their own machine and play your content right away!</dd>
      <dt><b>You can create your own pack either from an editor or manually.</b></dt>
      <dd>To create your own pack, you can enter any editor and try to create some new content. When asked what pack you want, you should see a button that lets you create a new pack. Alternatively, simply create a new folder within the <code>game_data</code> folder. The folder's name will be the pack's internal name. Then, add the <a href="#pack-props">pack properties file</a>. To add a thumbnail to your pack, place a file called <code>thumbnail.png</code> in the pack's folder. Like <a href="area.html">area</a> thumbnails, this should be around 400x400.</dd>
      <dt><b>When loading packs, the base pack is loaded first.</b></dt>
      <dd>When <i>Pikifen</i> loads something, it will start by checking all the files and folders that exist in the base pack. Then it will do the same for every other existing pack.</dd>
      <dt><b>Content with the same internal name will be overwritten.</b></dt>
      <dd>There can only be one piece of content by a given internal name. So you can't have two <code>water</code> hazards loaded, for instance. If a pack has a <code>water</code> hazard, but another pack that gets loaded later also has a <code>water</code> hazard, only the latter's will be loaded. This allows you, for instance, to replace content from the base pack with your own versions!</dd>
      <dt><b>Sharing your pack is ideally done with a zip file.</b></dt>
      <dd>When you want to share your content with others, it's recommended that you right-click your pack's folder, and zip it. The exact option you should click depends on your operative system and programs, but you're looking for an option to create a compressed archive file, otherwise known as a zip file. It's better to compress the pack folder as a whole, and not the contents <i>inside</i> the folder. Once you share it (try the <a href="https://discord.gg/qbhz4u3">Discord server</a>!), any player that wants to try your content simply needs to download your zip file, extract it, and place the extracted folder in their own <code>game_data</code> folder!</dd>
    </dl>

    <h3 id="pack-props">Pack properties</h3>

    <p>Inside a pack's folder, the <code>data.txt</code> file contains the following properties about the pack:</p>

    <h2 id="tips">Tips</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>If you've made changes to a piece of content, chances are you don't need to close the engine to test your changes (with a few exceptions). Simply reload the current area.</li>
      <li>Avoid using highly-saturated or bright colors in general. Those colors work better to call attention to the player, like a Pikmin's idle glow, or some HUD element. If everything is bright, not only does it make it so no element can call the player's attention, but also gives the game a sort of "plastic" look.</li>
      <li>When making Pikmin types, avoid making them solid green or black. Green Pikmin blend too much with grass, a floor texture encountered in a lot of places, and black Pikmin are too hard to see in darker places. If you want, you can add some details so at least some part of the Pikmin can be seen clearly.</li>
      <li>When creating some content that will only be used as a gimmick in a specific area, try naming it after the area's name. e.g. "Backyard Garden sprinkler". This way, your name doesn't clash with other content that has a similar name but is used in some other area. Plus, if someone checks the list of objects, textures, etc., they can right away understand what that specific niche thing is used for.</li>
      <li>When you try to edit the base pack inside of an editor, a warning will pop-up, since it's recommended that you don't change the base pack. To bypass this warning, change the <code>engine_developer</code> <a href="options.html">option</a>.</li>
