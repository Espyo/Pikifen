    <p>How to deal with problems in <i>Pikifen</i>.</p>

    <h2 id="general">General</h2>

    <p>If you have a problem, please follow these steps:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        Make sure your <i>Pikifen</i> installation is correct:
        <ul>
          <li>Make sure you're running the most recent version of the engine. This is because that version might've solved your problem.</li>
          <li>Make sure you're not running the game from inside a zip file. Remember that when you download the engine's zip file, you need to unzip everything inside of it into a folder before you're able to play.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Otherwise, if you made some content for the engine and you suspect that that is the problem, please check the <code>user_data/error_log.txt</code> file, if it exists. It should tell you what went wrong, like a missing comma, or a misspelled name. Fix the problems and try again.</li>
      <li>Otherwise, read the rest of this page to see if your problem is known.</li>
      <li>Otherwise, please <a href="#reporting">report it</a>!</li>
    </ol>

    <h3 id="playing">Problems during gameplay</h3>
    
    <dl>
      <dt><b>Why can't I see the game window?</b></dt>
      <dd>Because windows sometimes break under Windows.</dd>
      <dd>In the <a href="options.html">options file</a>, there is a line that controls the window position hack feature. Set that property to <code>true</code>.</dd>
      
      <dt><b>Why is it running slowly?</b></dt>
      <dd>Well, it IS a complex engine running a lot of flexible logic that controls several dozens of entities, so it's only natural.</dd>
      <dd>You can check tweak some <a href="options.html">options</a> in order to sacrifice appearance for performance.</dd>
      <dd>If you suspect some of the content you've made is having an impact on performance, try the <a href="maker_toolkit.html#perf-mon">performance monitor</a>.</dd>
      
      <dt><b>Why are some parts of the logic and physics so broken?</b></dt>
      <dd>Because their code is still under construction, most likely.</dd>
      
      <dt><b>Why are some textures black, but not HUD elements?</b></dt>
      <dd>Are you running it under Wine? If so, update Wine. That fixed the problem for a friend that had it. If not, contact me, and I'll try to see what's up.</dd>
      
      <dt><b>Why does the engine think I'm touching the analog stick when I'm not?</b></dt>
      <dd>You can open the <a href="options.html">options file</a> and adjust the option that controls the joystick minimum deadzone to a higher value. This way, a loose analog stick won't be accounted for if it is simply wiggling a bit.</dd>
    </dl>
    
    <h3 id="making">Problems while making content</h3>
    
    <dl>
      <dt><b>Why do I see everything in a single line when I open a <a href="making.html#data-file">data file</a> with Notepad?</b></dt>
      <dd>Don't use Notepad. It has a hard time doing LF-only line breaks, which most of the engine's files use.</dd>
      <dd>Install Notepad++ and start using that instead, since it's better in every way.</dd>

      <dt><b>Why are my graphics showing up as black and violet patterns?</b></dt>
      <dd>
        That's what the engine shows when it can't open a texture. Make sure you're following these points:
        <ul>
          <li>Internal names are based on <a href="glossary.html#file-name">file names</a>, which are case sensitive. Lowercase and uppercase matter.</li>
          <li>The engine only searches for the image in <code>game_data/&lt;<a href="making.html#packs">pack</a>&gt;/graphics</code>.</li>
        </ul>
      </dd>

      <dt><b>One of my textures is cutting off to black or to garbage, in a repeating pattern.</b></dt>
      <dd>Your texture's resolution does not use power-of-two numbers (64x64, 128x128, 256x256, etc.). It doesn't happen on all machines, but that's the solution, I guess...</dd>

      <dt><b>I'm having a hard time understanding X.</b></dt>
      <dd>Please let me know. I try to make the interface, mechanics, and tutorials be as easy to understand as possible.</dd>
      <dd>If you contact me, I can help you with your problem, as well as change things to make them easier to understand in the future.</dd>
    </dl>

    <h3 id="known_issues">Known issues</h3>

    <p>This is a list of problems with the engine that are known to exist, but can't be solved right now, either because they are too difficult to fix, or because they are not a priority. When possible, a solution or workaround is presented too.</p>

    <dl>
      <dt><b>In the area editor, when you have a square sector with another square sector inside, if you try to move an edge from the internal sector into the equivalent external sector's edge, but the external sector's edge has some moot vertexes (vertexes where both edges at 180 degrees), the area's geometry will break.</b></dt>
      <dd>If this happens to you, just undo and make sure there are no moot vertexes in the destination edge.</dd>

      <dt><b>In the area editor, if a vertex has two edges at opposite angles, but said angles are not axis-aligned, then you start drawing a new sector by starting on one edge, and clicking the other, then that will break the geometry.</b></dt>
      <dd>Please do not do that.</dd>

      <dt><b>Objects blindly pick the start and end path stops in a path by just checking which are closest to the start and end coordinates.</b></dt>
      <dd>I could make the objects also check if they're not entering a path graph with no return, or a path stop that's in a hazard they are vulnerable to, or a path stop that's meant for airborne travel only (which isn't even a thing, since only path links determine that), or so on. But that would be very difficult, and would lead to bizarre unintuitive behaviors, not to mention performance issues.</dd>
      
      <dt><b>Some wall shadows that fade away into a small size look really thin.</b></dt>
      <dd>Technically the engine is drawing the shapes of the shadows correctly, from a thick size to a small size, but the color interpolation done by the graphics backend sometimes does a bad job when the final two points of the shadow are so thin. There is not much that can be done to fix this.</dd>

      <dt><b>Some wall shadows interfere with other nearby wall shadows.</b></dt>
      <dd>Use the edge properties panel in the area editor to tweak the way the shadows work. Making them shorter is a good general solution.</dd>

      <dt><b>Objects can go from underneath a bridge to the top of it.</b></dt>
      <dd>So long as an object can climb onto one of the (disconnected) boards that make up a slanted bridge, the engine will let them do so. It's very difficult to detect if an object is going from "under" the bridge, since that's not a concept for the engine. The first <i>Pikmin</i> game has a very similar glitch. This shouldn't be a problem in most cases since if you can get underneath the bridge, chances are you can get to its starting point. Still, when designing areas, make sure players can't exploit this to get where they shouldn't.</dd>
    </dl>

    <h2 id="bug-reporting">Bug reporting</h2>

    <p>So you found a bug in <i>Pikifen</i>? Assuming that you've already followed the <a href="#general">general procedure above</a>, please let me know about it so I can fix it! You can report an issue with either the engine itself or any of the base content.</p>

    <p>To report a bug, you can either do so on the Discord server's bug reporting channel, or by opening an issue on the <a href="https://github.com/Espyo/Pikifen/issues">GitHub issues page</a>. Please make sure the problem isn't already reported by someone else. In your bug report, please include the following:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><b>Description</b>: A description of the bug. If it's not painfully obvious, you should also explain what exactly is wrong, and what you expected to happen instead. If you have a screenshot or a video of the bug in action, that'd be very appreciated.</li>
      <li><b>Steps to reproduce</b>: I'll want to do the same things you did in order to face the bug myself, so it's important that you find and report a way to reproduce the bug. If you can't, please list off what you were doing in the moments leading up to the bug happening.</li>
      <li><b>Error log</b>: Especially important for crashes, you should share the contents of your error log file. A screenshot may have also been created in the <code>user_data</code> folder, so share that too.</li>
      <li><b>Content modifications</b>: If you've created some content <a href="making.html#packs">pack</a> or changed the base content, please let me know what you have done, since the problem might depend on those changes.</li>
      <li>
        <b>Extra notes</b>: Any extra notes you feel are relevant to helping me figure out the issue. Some ideas:
        <ul>
          <li>You should always be using the latest official version of <i>Pikifen</i>, but in case you're using an older version or on a git commit farther ahead than the latest official version, please specify that information too.</li>
          <li>If your problem is related to something system-wide, like the game window, graphic or audio corruptions, file mishaps, etc., please specify your operating system.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
