    <b>Pellets</b> are carriable objects that simply give more Pikmin, when delivered to an Onion.

    <p>Examples of pellet types include the Red 1 pellet, the Red 5 pellet, the Yellow 1 pellet, etc.</p>

    <p>To create a new type of pellet, please follow the <a href="mob_type.html">making object types tutorial</a>.</p>

    <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

    <p>Each pellet object type can be bound to one type of Pikmin. Its color and look can be anything, though. That said, a pellet is forced to have a number drawn on top of it. Each pellet type is bound to one Pikmin type, and has data on how many seeds to give when the Pikmin type matches the Onion, and how many for when it doesn't.</p>

    <p>Pellet type objects are hardcoded in the engine to be carriable, have a number displayed on top of them, have a number for Pikmin type match seeds, and a number for non-match seeds.</p>

    <h2 id="animations">Animations</h2>

    <p>A pellet type needs to have the following animations:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><b><code>idling</code></b>: Idling; used for everything. This should not include the number, since the number is placed on top of the pellet during gameplay.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="script">Script</h2>

    <p>Pellet types have hardcoded <a href="script.html">scripts</a>, so the only thing you can do is enhance them.</p>

    <p>Some <a href="script.html#vars">script variables</a> control special behavior, like the pellet's starting team. To know which ones exist, you can go to the area editor, select a pellet, and read the tooltip of each variable.</p>
