    <p>A glossary of terms used in <i>Pikifen</i>, both for casual play, and for making content. This glossary will not include terms popular in the <i>Pikmin</i> franchise, since you can find more about those on <a href="https://www.pikminwiki.com">Pikipedia</a>, and will also not focus on terms used in the engine's code, even though most of them match what you'd read outside of the code.</p>

    <dl id="9-slice">
      <dt>9-slice</dt>
      <dd>A texture typically applied on a <a href="#gui">GUI</a> item that has variable size, like a button. In-engine, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9-slice_scaling">9-slice texture</a> is split into three equal-sized rows and three equal-sized columns. The corners are then used for the item's corners as-is, but the edges and center are stretched to fit.</dd>

    <dl id="absolute-angle">
      <dt>Absolute angle</dt>
      <dd>Unlike a <a href="#relative-angle">relative angle</a>, this refers to the <a href="#angle">angle</a> facing a cardinal direction in the area. 0 points to the right/east, 10 means 10 degrees clockwise of east, etc.</dd>

    <dl id="active">
      <dt>Active</dt>
      <dd>If an object is active that means it will be processed on the current frame. To save on performance, objects that are off-camera and too far from any Pikmin or leader (and also not marked as always-active) will become inactive, meaning they are essentially frozen in time. In reality they don't process their logic each frame, and/or don't check for interactions with other objects, but they still receive events, can spawn and despawn, etc.</dd>
    </dl>
    <dl id="animation">
      <dt>Animation</dt>
      <dd>A series of <a href="#frame">frames</a> that change the way an object looks. When put together nicely, these make it look like the object is walking, growling, chomping, etc. Animations are independent of what the object is actually doing. For instance, it can be walking, but it could be frozen in appearance, which would make it appear to slide. That said, accurate animations are necessary for gameplay reasons, like <a href="#hitbox">hitboxes</a>.</dd>

    <dl id="assert">
      <dt>Assert, Assertion</dt>
      <dd>When something is wrong with the engine, and it is detected by an assertion, the program usually shuts down in a controlled manner. This helps because the developer can know what assert was triggered exactly, to make finding the problem easier.</dd>

    <dl id="glow">
      <dt>Glow</dt>
      <dd>A way to brighten up an object.
