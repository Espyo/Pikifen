    <p>A glossary of terms used in <i>Pikifen</i>, both for casual play, and for making content. This glossary will not include terms popular in the <i>Pikmin</i> franchise, since you can find more about those on <a href="https://www.pikminwiki.com">Pikipedia</a>, and will also not focus on terms used in the engine's code, even though most of them match what you'd read outside of the code.</p>

      <dt>Absolute angle</dt>
      <dd>Unlike a <a href="#relative-angle">relative angle</a>, this refers to the <a href="#angle">angle</a> facing a cardinal direction in the area. 0 points to the right/east, 10 means 10 degrees clockwise of east, etc.</dd>

    <dl id="action">
      <dt>Action</dt>
      <dd>Something that an object can do in its <a href="#script">script</a>. This includes walking to a certain point, losing <a href="#health">health</a>, changing its <a href="#animation">animation</a>, etc.</dd>

    <dl id="active">
      <dt>Active</dt>
      <dd>If an object is active that means it will be processed on the current frame. To save on performance, objects that are off-camera and too far from any Pikmin or leader (and also not marked as always-active) will become inactive, meaning they are essentially frozen in time. In reality they don't process their logic each frame, and/or don't check for interactions with other objects, but they still receive events, can spawn and despawn, etc.</dd>
    </dl>
    <dl id="animation">
      <dt>Animation</dt>
      <dd>A series of <a href="#frame">frames</a> that change the way an object looks. When put together nicely, these make it look like the object is walking, growling, chomping, etc. Animations are independent of what the object is actually doing. For instance, it can be walking, but it could be frozen in appearance, which would make it appear to slide. That said, accurate animations are necessary for gameplay reasons, like <a href="#hitbox">hitboxes</a>.</dd>

    <dl id="angle">

    <dl id="assert">
      <dt>Assert, Assertion</dt>
      <dd>When something is wrong with the engine, and it is detected by an assertion, the program usually shuts down in a controlled manner. This helps because the developer can know what assert was triggered exactly, to make finding the problem easier.</dd>

    <dl id="glow">
      <dt>Glow</dt>
      <dd>A way to brighten up an object.

      <dt>Hazard</dt>
      <dd>Like in the canon games, a hazard refers to the concept of danger, not to a physical object. Electricity (danger of being shocked), fire (danger of burning up), etc. are all hazards, but electrical wires, fire geysers, and so on are just obstacles whose attacks involve hazards.</dd>

    <dl id="height-effect">
      <dt>Height effect</dt>
      <dd>To help portray depths, objects that are in mid-air may appear larger than they would appear on land. Or if they are falling into a pit, they may appear smaller and smaller. This is called the "height effect".</dd>

      <dd>When an object has been taking damage for a while, an "itch" <a href="#event">event</a> will be triggered. This periodic event allows an enemy to shake Pikmin off when it is under attack. In order for the enemy to not shake several times in a row, an "itch" event will only be triggered if enough time has passed since the last one, and if enough damage has been done since the last one.</dd>

This is assuming the object is facing the right/east. If it isn't, the coordinates rotate around the object, such that a positive X is always in front of the object.
