    <b>Converters</b> are objects that convert a Pikmin from one type to another. They're the Candypop Buds in the main series, whether the normal single-typed Candypop Buds, or the Queen Candypop Bud.

    <p>Examples of converter types include the Crimson Candypop Bud, the Golden Candypop Bud, and the Queen Candypop Bud.</p>

    <p>To create a new type of converter, please follow the <a href="mob_type.html">making object types tutorial</a>.</p>

    <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

    <p>The converter object just sits there, and when a Pikmin is thrown inside, it is stored inside. After some seconds have passed, the object has been bumped against, or enough Pikmin have been stored at once, the converter closes, and spits out seeds of the new type. Some converters can also change their Pikmin type with time, cycling through them so the player can throw Pikmin at the right time to get the type of Pikmin they want.</p>

    <p>Converter type objects are hardcoded in the engine to sit there and wait for Pikmin to be thrown inside, store them, close, spit new seeds, open up, wither out, be bumped against, and change the output type with time.</p>

    <h2 id="animations">Animations</h2>

    <p>A converter type needs to have the following animations. Note that for every type of Pikmin it can output, you need another set of these animations, and each set needs to end with the suffix you specified in the <code>type_animation_suffixes</code> property.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><b><code>idling</code></b>: Just idling.</li>
      <li><b><code>bumped</code></b>: When it's been bumped against.</li>
      <li><b><code>closing</code></b>: Closing.</li>
      <li><b><code>spitting</code></b>: Spitting out the new seeds.</li>
      <li><b><code>opening</code></b>: Opening back up.</li>
      <li><b><code>dying</code></b>: Dying.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="sounds">Sounds</h2>
    
    <p>A converter type needs to have the following <a href="mob_type.html#sounds">sounds</a>:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><b><code>reception</code></b>: Received a Pikmin.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="script">Script</h2>

    <p>Converter types have hardcoded <a href="script.html">scripts</a>, so the only thing you can do is enhance them.</p>

    <p>Some <a href="script.html#vars">script variables</a> control special behavior, like the converter's starting team. To know which ones exist, you can go to the area editor, select a converter, and read the tooltip of each variable.</p>
