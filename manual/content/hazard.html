    <p>This page will guide you on how to make hazards for <i>Pikifen</i>. Each hazard is a piece of <a href="making.html#content">content</a>, so you should know how content works in the engine in general before starting. For clarity, know that a hazard is just an abstract danger, not a physical object. Poison, fire, water, electricity, are all hazards. Gas pipes and fire geysers are obstacles, bodies of water are a type of sector, and electrical attacks from enemies are a property given to an attack; all of these <i>use</i> a hazard, but are not hazards.</p>

    <h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
    
    <p>Pikmin can be vulnerable or invulnerable to a certain hazard. If they are invulnerable, they will be completely invulnerable to any attack hitboxes that use that property, and will act as if it doesn't exist. If not, it will suffer from some <b>status effect</b>. Being on fire, flailing on the surface of the water, or choking on poison are all status effects. Before you implement hazards, you should have some status effects, otherwise the hazards will be pointless if they can't cause problems. Please read the <a href="status.html">status effects guide</a> for information on how to declare status effects.</p>

    <p>The folders <code>game_data/&lt;<a href="making.html#packs">pack</a>&gt;/hazards</code> contain one <a href="making.html#data-file">data file</a> for every hazard that exists, and that file contains its properties.</p>

    <h2 id="basics">Basics</h2>
    
    <p>To create a hazard, simply specify the following properties in its file:</p>

    <h3 id="common">Common</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>All of the <a href="making.html#content-props">common content properties</a>.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 id="optional">Optional</h3>
    
    <table class="props-t props-t-o">
      <tr>
        <td>color</td>
        <td>A color that represents the hazard.</td>
        <td>Color</td>
        <td>0 0 0 0</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>liquid</td>
        <td>If this hazard has an associated liquid (read the next section), specify its name here.</td>
        <td>Text</td>
        <td></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>status</td>
        <td>Status effects to apply to any Pikmin that is not invulnerable.</td>
        <td>Text list</td>
        <td></td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <h2 id="liquid">Water and other liquids</h2>
    
    <p>As stated at the start of the page, a hazard is an abstract danger. This means that a body of water is not a hazard, but the concept of "water" is. The thing is, hazards like water and other liquids (e.g. acid or lava) are meant to be used in sectors and have a liquid appearance, with an animated water surface. Simply stating that a water hazard applies the "drowning" effect to non-Blue Pikmin, and having a sector use the "water" hazard is not enough. How can the engine know what color the water is, how opaque it is, and what its surface animation is? For this, we'll need a different file.</p>

    <p>Open the <code>game_data/&lt;<a href="making.html#packs">pack</a>&gt;/liquids</code> folder. This contains data about all liquids. Liquids will bridge the gap between a water body sector and the water hazard, for instance. Much like the files in <code>game_data/&lt;<a href="making.html#packs">pack</a>&gt;/hazards</code>, this folder contains <a href="making.html#data-file">data files</a>, one for each liquid defined.</p>

    <p>Each liquid has the following properties:</p>

    <h3 id="liquid-common">Common</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>All of the <a href="making.html#content-props">common content properties</a>.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 id="liquid-optional">Optional</h3>
    
    <table class="props-t props-t-o">
      <tr>
        <td>body_color</td>
        <td>Color of the liquid. In-game, the terrain below the liquid's surface will be tinted with this color.</td>
        <td>Color</td>
        <td>0 0 0 255</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>radar_color</td>
        <td>Color to use for this liquid in the radar. In-game, it'll be slightly tinted with the terrain elevation color.</td>
        <td>Color</td>
        <td>0 0 0 0</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>shine_color</td>
        <td>Color to use for this liquid's shine (i.e. water caustics). In-game, occasional shines that appear in the liquid will be tinted this color.</td>
        <td>Color</td>
        <td>255 255 255 255</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>distortion_amount</td>
        <td>Liquids bend the texture underneath them to create their effect. This value indicates the maximum units the liquid can bend the texture by.</td>
        <td>Point</td>
        <td>14 4</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>shine_amount</td>
        <td>Amount of the surface that gets covered in shine. This number is used in some internal calculations, and ranges from 0 to 1.</td>
        <td>Number</td>
        <td>0.6</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>animation_speed</td>
        <td>Multiplier for how fast the water animates.</td>
