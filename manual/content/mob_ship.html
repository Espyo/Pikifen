    <p>A <b>ship</b> type refers to any vessel that the Pikmin can deliver treasure, berries, etc. to. They may also house Pikmin inside, and leaders may also heal on them.</p>

    <p>Examples of ship types include the S.S. Dolphin, Hocotate ship, the Hocotate ship's pod, etc.</p>

    <p>To create a new type of ship, please follow the <a href="mob_type.html">making object types tutorial</a>.</p>

    <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

    <p>Ships have a control point and a receptacle. The control point is on the floor, and is what the leader stands on to interact with the ship. It is also the spot Pikmin deliver objects to. The receptacle is the part of the ship that actually receives the object. When an object is delivered, it gets sucked in via a beam from the control point to the receptacle.</p>

    <p>Ships can also store Pikmin inside, like Onions, though they are incapable of generating Pikmin seeds.</p>

    <p>Ship type objects are hardcoded in the engine to sit there and accept delivered items, to heal leaders if possible, and to allow the player to manage the Pikmin inside if possibe.</p>

    <p>A ship type needs to have the following animations:</p>

    <p>Ship types have hardcoded <a href="script.html">scripts</a>, so the only thing you can do is enhance them.</p>

    <p>Some <a href="script.html#vars">script variables</a> control special behavior, like the ship's starting Pikmin count. To know which ones exist, you can go to the area editor, select a ship, and read the tooltip of each variable.</p>
