    <h2 id="creation">Creation</h2>
    
    <p>The idea for the engine started on mid-2013. I was itching to start a large new project, and after learning of <a href="https://www.pikminfanon.com">Pikmin Fanon</a>, I conjured the idea of creating an engine that would allow <i>Pikmin</i> fans to bring their game ideas to life. The concept of the "Pikmin fangame engine" was made public on the site, where <a href="https://www.pikminfanon.com/wiki/Topic:Pikmin_Engine_by_Espyo">a topic</a> was created to gather feedback before starting the project. On the 15th of August, 2013, development of the engine officially began. Ever since, different versions have been released, each one making the engine more complete than the last.</p>
    
    <p>On February 2nd, 2018, the project got rebranded, and the mission statement changed a bit. Instead of it being called "Pikmin fangame engine", it got renamed to "<i>Pikifen</i>", and the idea was no longer to make fan games a reality, since that proved to be too ambitious at best, and outright impossible at worst. Instead, the goal became to create a fun engine in which people could create and play their own content first, and the idea to make full games in it being secondary.</p>
