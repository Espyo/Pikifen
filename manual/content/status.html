    <p>This page will guide you in making status effects for <i>Pikifen</i>. Each status type is a piece of <a href="making.html#content">content</a> so you should know how content works in the engine in general before starting.</p>

    <h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
    
    <p>Status effects temporarily change an object's properties. While under a status effect, an object can be slower, stronger, colored differently, etc. Objects can be under multiple status effects at once. Examples of status effects are: on fire, spicy, petrified, drowning, etc.</p>

    <p>Status effects are defined in the <code>game_data/&lt;<a href="making.html#packs">pack</a>&gt;/statuses</code> folders. Every <a href="making.html#data-file">data file</a> defines a status effect, with its file name representing the effect's <a href="making.html#content">internal name</a>.</p>

    <h2 id="props">Properties</h2>
    
    <p>Each status effect has the following properties:</p>

    <h3 id="props-common">Common</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>All of the <a href="making.html#content-props">common content properties</a>.</li>
    </ul>
