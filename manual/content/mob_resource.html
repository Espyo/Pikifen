    <b>Resources</b> are objects that Pikmin can carry somewhere, and once delivered, they cause something to happen. These resources are almost always provided by a <a href="mob_pile.html">pile</a>.

    <p>Examples of resource types include Burgeoning Spiderwort berries, which get delivered to the ship to make sprays with, bridge fragments, which get delivered to the corresponding bridge, nuggets, which get delivered to the ship for points, etc.</p>

    <p>To create a new type of resource, please follow the <a href="mob_type.html">making object types tutorial</a>.</p>

    <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

    <p>A resource type specifies where the resource must be delivered, what happens to the resource when it's delivered, and what happens when it's dropped by the Pikmin.</p>

    <p>Resource type objects are hardcoded in the engine to sit there, be picked up by the Pikmin, be dropped by the Pikmin, vanish if necessary, and be delivered somewhere. There is also logic to cause something specific to happen when they are delivered.</p>

    <h2 id="animations">Animations</h2>

    <p>A resource type needs to have the following animations:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><b><code>idling</code></b>: Idling; used for everything.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="script">Script</h2>

    <p>Resource types have hardcoded <a href="script.html">scripts</a>, so the only thing you can do is enhance them.</p>

    <p>Some <a href="script.html#vars">script variables</a> control special behavior, like the resource's starting team. To know which ones exist, you can go to the area editor, select a resource, and read the tooltip of each variable.</p>
