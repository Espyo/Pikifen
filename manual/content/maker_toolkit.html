  <div id="page-content">
    
    <p>This page explains how to use and set up the maker toolkit on <i>Pikifen</i> &ndash; a set of tools that help while making content for the engine.</p>

    <h2 id="context">Context</h2>
    
    <p>Most of these tools are used while playing the engine, and are called by pressing the key or button bound to them in the options. Their effects vary, but their purpose is to help content makers by making mundane tasks easier and providing helpful information that can be useful in debugging any problems. It is possible to set which tools run on which player input, and it's also possible to change some of the tools' settings. There are also some other tools that are not run on demand and instead affect the behavior of some part of the game.</p>

    <p>You can hold down the input to repeat the effect over and over. This is useful, for instance, for spawning several Pikmin quickly. Some also change their behavior if you were holding the "modifier 1" or "modifier 2" inputs before pressing their input. A handful of the tools print out information on the top of the game window, on top of a see-through black box. This info disappears after some seconds, unless you call it again.</p>

    <h2 id="config">Configuration file</h2>
    
    <p>First of all, open <code>user_data/tools.txt</code>. This <a href="making.html#data-file">data file</a> will contain the information for the toolkit to work. It's got one block for the controls, and then a series of other blocks, one for each maker tool that can be customized.</p>

    <p>The <code>enabled</code> property at the top controls whether or not the toolkit is enabled.</p>

    <p>The <code>controls</code> block lists what control binds exist for each tool. These should be edited via the options menu. The number keys at the top of the letter keys are recommended!</p>

    <p>The remaining blocks have the name correspond to the internal name of each tool, listed in said tool's section in this page. The properties inside customize how it works, and are also listed in this page. Some of them have a <code>normal_settings</code>, a <code>mod_1_settings</code>, and a <code>mod_2_settings</code> block. These control what happens when you press their input solo, when you press it while holding "modifier 1", and when you press it while holding "modifier 2", respectively.</p>

    <h2 id="key-tools">Key tools</h2>
    
    <h3 id="area-image">Area image</h3>
    
    <p>Creates an image of the entire area and saves it in the <code>user_data</code> folder. This is a great way to show other people what your area is like. This draws the area just as it appears in-game, so with the objects and shadows and everything. The HUD won't be visible, though. How zoomed in or out the area is when compared to how it looks in-game depends on the size of the image. It is recommended that you don't try to aim for a 1:1 zoom level, but instead focus on having an image big enough for people to understand what is happening, but not so big that it is a pain to open.</p>

    <p><b>Tool internal name</b>: <code>area_image</code>.</p>

    <p><b>Properties</b>:</p>

    <p>Each of the <code>normal_settings</code>, <code>mod_1_settings</code>, and <code>mod_2_settings</code> blocks have these properties:</p>
    
    <table class="props-t props-t-o">
      <tr>
        <td>size</td>
        <td>Maximum image width or height, in pixels. 2048 is a good size for medium or large areas, otherwise 1024 works fine.</td>
        <td>Number</td>
        <td>2048</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>padding</td>
        <td>Padding around the actual area.</td>
        <td>Number</td>
        <td>32</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>mobs</td>
        <td>Whether you want to see objects, particle effects, etc.</td>
        <td>Boolean</td>
        <td>true</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>shadows</td>
        <td>Whether you want to see tree leaf shadows.</td>
        <td>Boolean</td>
        <td>true</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    
    <h3 id="auto-start">Auto start</h3>
    
    <p>If you find yourself opening the engine, going to the same game mode, menu, or area every time, closing down, and repeating the process over and over, you can use this tool to avoid going through the long way. It makes the engine start on something other than the title screen automatically, and also optionally automatically open a specific area, animation, etc. Press its input to set the current game state and the current content as the new auto-start point. To make it start at the title screen like normal, well, just press the input on the title screen!</p>

    <p><b>Tool internal name</b>: <code>auto_start</code>.</p>

    <p><b>Properties</b>:</p>

    <table class="props-t props-t-o">
      <tr>
        <td>state</td>
        <td>What mode to automatically start on. If left empty, the engine boots to the title screen as usual. Valid values are <code>play</code>, <code>animation_editor</code>, <code>area_editor</code>, <code>gui_editor</code>, or <code>particle_editor</code>.</td>
        <td>Text</td>
        <td></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>option</td>
        <td>What file or folder to load automatically. This should be a path starting from the engine's folder.</td>
        <td>Text</td>
        <td></td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <h3 id="speed">Change speed</h3>
    
    <p>Changes the game's flow of time, making it faster or slower. Press the tool's key while playing to switch from normal speed to the set speed, and then press again to return to normal. If you're testing something tedious, speeding up the gameplay means you have to wait less, and if you're trying to understand what is happening in a scenario that goes by too quickly, you can slow the game down. Note that the engine wasn't meant to run at these speeds, so some behaviors might not work properly, like objects being able to clip through walls they normally wouldn't.</p>

    <p><b>Tool internal name</b>: <code>change_speed</code>.</p>

    <p><b>Properties</b>:</p>

    <p>Each of the <code>normal_settings</code>, <code>mod_1_settings</code>, and <code>mod_2_settings</code> blocks have these properties:</p>

    <table class="props-t props-t-o">
      <tr>
        <td>multiplier</td>
        <td>Game speed multiplier. 1 is normal speed, 0.5 is half speed, 2.0 is double speed, etc.</td>
        <td>Number</td>
        <td>2</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <h3 id="frame-advance">Frame advance</h3>
    
    <p>When initially activated, it enters frame advance mode, which pauses gameplay. Then, any subsequent activation will advance gameplay by one frame. How much one frame is worth here depends on the framerate specified in the <a href="options.html">options</a>. If you were holding "modifier 1", it will leave frame advance mode and return to normal. It will also return to normal if you <a href="#speed">change the game speed</a>.</p>
    <p>Some things, like cursor control, happen independently of the framerate, so expect to still see some stuff moving. Also, internally, it's not actually freezing one frame forever, but setting the game speed to an ultra-slow speed. This simplifies a lot of internal logic (by avoiding divisions by 0!), but it works more than well for practical use.</p>

    <p><b>Tool internal name</b>: <code>frame_advance</code>.</p>

    <p><b>Properties</b>: none.</p>

    <h3 id="geometry-info">Geometry info</h3>
    
    <p>Prints out geometry info about what's under the mouse cursor (or stops if pressed again), on the top of the game window. It uses the mouse cursor for this, not the leader's cursor. This prints out the cursor's coordinates, as well as some basic info about the sector that the cursor is on: its height and texture.</p>
    
    <p><b>Tool internal name</b>: <code>geometry_info</code>.</p>

    <p><b>Properties</b>: none.</p>

    <h3 id="hud">HUD</h3>
    
    <p>Toggles the HUD's visibility on or off. Good for taking screenshots with.</p>
    
    <p><b>Tool internal name</b>: <code>hud</code>.</p>

    <p><b>Properties</b>: none.</p>

    <h3 id="hurt-mob">Hurt mob</h3>
    
    <p>Hurts the mob closest to the cursor. It uses the mouse cursor for this, not the leader's cursor. It saps away some half of its health every time you press it, meaning you can kill anything with just two presses (or more, if it regenerates). It's useful to kill troublesome enemies or boring obstacles without having to deal with them. Note that if you hold down the key, you'll be able to kill several mobs quickly, but if you don't pay attention, you could end up killing an object you didn't mean to, like your leader. To note also is that the mob does not receive any damage-related event with this, so it will never react to having lost health, even if its script says it should. It will die normally, however.</p>
    
    <p><b>Tool internal name</b>: <code>hurt_mob</code>.</p>

    <p><b>Properties</b>:</p>

    <p>Each of the <code>normal_settings</code>, <code>mod_1_settings</code>, and <code>mod_2_settings</code> blocks have these properties:</p>

    <table class="props-t props-t-o">
      <tr>
        <td>percentage</td>
        <td>How much of the mob's total health should be lost each time. 50 is 50%, 100 will kill any mob instantly, etc.</td>
        <td>Number</td>
        <td>50</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <h3 id="mob-info">Mob info</h3>
    
    <p>Prints out important information about the mob closest to the cursor, on the top of the game window. It uses the mouse cursor for this, not the leader's cursor. When you press the button, it locks-on to that mob, and only unlocks if the mob is deleted or if you press the button again while pointing to the same mob. Pointing to a different mob will lock to that one instead. This lock-on can also be useful for other maker tools. If you were holding "modifier 1", it will instead scan for mobs whose centers are around the cursor, and iterate between them; this is useful if multiple mobs are bundled in the same spot. If you were holding "modifier 2", it will stop locking on. The information shown is:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li><b>Name</b>: The name of the type of mob this is (e.g. Red Bulborb, Olimar).</li>
      <li><b>Coords</b>: The mob's current coordinates, separated by space. The third coordinate is the Z, which means its vertical position.</li>
      <li><b>State hist.</b>: Name of the script states it has gone through (up to 4). The current one is the first on the list.</li>
      <li><b>Health</b>: Current health amount.</li>
      <li><b>Timer</b>: Time left on the currently running script timer, if any.</li>
      <li><b>Animation</b>: Name of the current playing animation, if any.</li>
      <li><b>Vars</b>: Name and value of all script variables.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>As such, the information shown is mostly useful to debug scripts and animations. </p>
    
    <p><b>Tool internal name</b>: <code>mob_info</code>.</p>

    <p><b>Properties</b>: none.</p>

    <h3 id="new-pikmin">New Pikmin</h3>
    
    <p>Creates a new flower Pikmin where the cursor is, in the idle state. This uses the mouse cursor, not the leader's cursor. The type of the Pikmin created depends on the previous Pikmin created this way, in that it follows a cycle, alphabetically going through all Pikmin types declared in the engine. This tool is very useful if you need more Pikmin with you instantly. You can hold down the key to create a large army of Pikmin in a short time. If you were holding "modifier 1", it will spawn a Pikmin of the same type as the previous. If you were holding "modifier 2", the Pikmin will be a leaf Pikmin.</p>
    
    <p><b>Tool internal name</b>: <code>new_pikmin</code>.</p>

    <p><b>Properties</b>: none.</p>
    
    <h3 id="path-info">Path info</h3>
    
    <p>When on, prints out important information about the path that the <a href="#mob-info">locked-on mob</a> is taking. It also draws its path on the area. Pressing the button toggles the feature on and off.</p>

    <p>The information at the top is:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>The result of the path calculation, which helps explain how and why the object chose that path, or failed to find one.</li>
      <li>The number of the stop it is heading to, and the total number of stops. These numbers refer to the stops in the list of the object's current path.</li>
      <li>A list of settings about the path, like whether it's airborne, or a light load. Some of the settings listed are more internal for the engine.</li>
      <li>Whether the path is currently blocked, and if so, why.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Drawn on the area are:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Faint lines chart out the full path. Blue are normal lines, red are blocked by an obstacle.</li>
      <li>A colored red circle represents the first path stop in the path.</li>
      <li>A colored green circle represents the last path stop in the path.</li>
      <li>A thick blue line represents the direction towards the next stop, or the destination. If it's a stop, that stop is also highlighted with a smaller blue circle. These colors are red instead of the path is blocked.</li>
      <li>A square on the destination spot, with a thin circle representing the distance for which the object considers the pathing finished.</li>
      <li>A red diamond shape if the starting position had to be faked, and a green one for the ending position. This is used, for instance, by ceramic bridges to make sure the Pikmin walks across the half-built bridge to deliver their fragment, even if it's out of the path.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>If an object is not following a path like you expect it to, using this tool will help you figure out why.</p>
    
    <p><b>Tool internal name</b>: <code>path_info</code>.</p>

    <p><b>Properties</b>: none.</p>

    <h3 id="set-song-pos-near-loop">Set song position near loop</h3>
    
    <p>Changes the current position of all songs to be just a few seconds before their loop point. This is useful when you want to test the loop points and don't want to wait until the song gets there normally.</p>
    
    <p><b>Tool internal name</b>: <code>set_song_pos_near_loop</code>.</p>

    <p><b>Properties</b>: none.</p>

    <h3 id="collision">Show collision</h3>
    
    <p>Toggles visibility of mob collision boxes/bubbles. This is just a simple unfilled circle or rectangle, and for objects that push with their hitboxes, each hitbox's bubble will be shown too.</p>

    <p><b>Tool internal name</b>: <code>collision</code>.</p>

    <p><b>Properties</b>: none.</p>

    <h3 id="hitboxes">Show hitboxes</h3>
    
    <p>Toggles visibility of mob hitboxes in-game. For each mob that has hitboxes, they will appear overlaid on top of it, and with a color scheme similar to the animation editor (green for hitboxes that can be damaged, red for those currently causing damage, and yellow for ignored ones).</p>

    <p><b>Tool internal name</b>: <code>hitboxes</code>.</p>

    <p><b>Properties</b>: none.</p>

    <h3 id="reaches">Show reaches</h3>
    
    <p>Toggles visibility of mob reaches in-game. This only affects the <a href="#mob-info">locked-on mob</a>. It will show pie-slices or circles for the current far reach in red, and for the current near reach in green.</p>

    <p><b>Tool internal name</b>: <code>reaches</code>.</p>

    <p><b>Properties</b>: none.</p>

    <h3 id="teleport">Teleport</h3>
    
    <p>Teleports the current leader to the cursor's position. This uses the mouse cursor, not the leader's cursor. Use this to go somewhere instantly or to move around the area quickly. Keep in mind that Pikmin in your party will not teleport with you, so they may have a hard time following you. This also has some technical drawbacks: Pikmin may go to an incorrect spot when trying to stay on the group, and the leader's vertical position may not be updated correctly. Neither of these are critical and eventually fix themselves. You can also hold down the key to repeatedly go to the cursor, which updates with the leader, meaning that this allows you to quickly move through everything in the direction the cursor is. This is however very hard to control. If you were holding "modifier 1", it will instead teleport the mob that's <a href="#mob-info">locked-on</a>.</p>

    <p><b>Tool internal name</b>: <code>teleport</code>.</p>

    <p><b>Properties</b>: none.</p>

    <h2 id="others">Other tools</h2>
    
    <h3 id="perf-mon">Performance monitor</h3>
    
    <p>When you enter an area, the engine loads a lot of content, and does a lot processing to get the gameplay state ready. This procedure takes a few seconds. If you suspect some of your content is causing the load times to be too high, you can use the performance monitor to find out how long the engine takes on each part of the area loading procedure. Likewise, while playing, the engine needs to process and draw several different things. If the framerate (press <a href="misc_features.html#system-info">F1</a> by default) is low or unstable, and you suspect some of your content is to blame, the performance monitor can help you here too.</p>
    
    <p>The monitor can be either on or off. If you don't need it, keep it off, since it can slow the game down! When you turn it on, any area you enter will be monitored. When you quit via the main menu, the engine will generate a performance report about the area's loading procedure and the frames of gameplay. The report can be found in <code>user_data/performance_log.txt</code>.</p>
    
    <p>The data for each recorded area is split into four parts. The first is the loading times; with this, you can tell how long the engine took to load the particle generator info, the HUD settings, the weather data, etc. For object types, it will also split the measurements by each category of object type. Besides that, the log will also show how long it took to process the different parts of the area generation procedure. All of this information can help you realize what's making your area take so long to load &ndash; maybe it has too many objects, maybe its sectors are too complex, or maybe your pellet graphics are just too high-resolution.</p>
    
    <p>The other three parts of the report refer to the framerate. The second part measures how long the average frame takes to process and draw on the game window, while the third and fourth parts report the fastest frame you had, and the slowest, respectively. This difference can be useful in figuring out if something during gameplay is causing severe frame drops. In these reports, the log will tell you how long the engine takes to completely process one frame, measuring how long it takes to process all particles, object physics, etc., as well as how long it takes to draw the background, world components, HUD, and so on. With this data, you may come to a conclusion about what's making your framerate be so low, or so unstable &ndash; maybe your area has too many objects colliding against each other, maybe one of your enemy scripts is too heavy when doing some specific calculation, or maybe you just have way too many tree shadows.</p>
