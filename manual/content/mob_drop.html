    <b>Drops</b> are any kind of droplet that can be drunk by a Pikmin or a leader. Once the Pikmin or leader has finished slurping up their portion, they will be affected in some way, like having their maturity boosted, or having the number of sprays increased.

    <p>Examples of drop types include nectar, which flowers up the Pikmin, ultra-spicy nectar, which gives the leaders one extra usage of ultra-spicy spray, etc.</p>

    <p>To create a new type of drop, please follow the <a href="mob_type.html">making object types tutorial</a>.</p>

    <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

    <p>A drop type object can only be drunk by either a Pikmin or a leader, not both. For Pikmin, their maturity can be increased, for leaders, their spray count for a given spray can be increased, and for either, they can undergo a <a href="status.html">status effect</a>. Each type of drop can also have a different amount of doses, and shrink down at different speeds.</p>

    <p>Drop type objects are hardcoded in the engine to sit there and, when an object that wants to drink them approaches, have their doses dropped down by one, and give the corresponding object an effect once that dose is finished being slurped. They can also be bumped against to slosh around in place.</p>

    <h2 id="animations">Animations</h2>

    <p>A drop type needs to have the following animations:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><b><code>idling</code></b>: Idling.</li>
      <li><b><code>falling</code></b>: Falling down. Normally used after it's thrown when being spawn, like when it pops out of an egg.</li>
      <li><b><code>landing</code></b>: Lands on the floor from falling.</li>
      <li><b><code>bumped</code></b>: When it's been bumped against.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="script">Script</h2>

    <p>Drop types have hardcoded <a href="script.html">scripts</a>, so the only thing you can do is enhance them.</p>

    <p>Some <a href="script.html#vars">script variables</a> control special behavior, like the drop's starting team. To know which ones exist, you can go to the area editor, select a drop, and read the tooltip of each variable.</p>
