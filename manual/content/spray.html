    <p>This page will guide you in making spray types for <i>Pikifen</i>. Each spray type is a piece of <a href="making.html#content">content</a> so you should know how content works in the engine in general before starting.</p>

    <h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
    
    <p>Whenever a leader uses a spray, they spray a bunch of particles in a given direction, and certain objects, dictated by the rules of the spray, will befall under some status effect. A status effect can make them faster (like an ultra-spicy spray), or make them stop on their tracks (like an ultra-bitter spray), amongst other things. Before creating sprays, you must have some status effect definitions. If you don't, please read the <a href="status.html">status effects guide</a> for information on how to create some.</p>

    <p>Spray definitions can be found in the <code>game_data/&lt;<a href="making.html#packs">pack</a>&gt;/sprays</code> folders. Every <a href="making.html#data-file">data file</a> there defines a spray, with its file name representing the spray type's <a href="making.html#content">internal name</a>.</p>

    <h2 id="props">Properties</h2>
    
    <p>Every spray file has these properties:</p>

    <h3 id="props-common">Common</h3>

      <li>All of the <a href="making.html#content-props">common content properties</a>.</li>
