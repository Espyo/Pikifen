    <p>A type of <b>leader</b> represents a playable character. Since you can have any number of instances of the same type in the same area, you can effectively have multiple Olimars roaming about. Whether you want to or not is up to you though! At least one leader is required to be in the area in order to play it.</p>

    <p>Examples of leader types include Olimar, Louie, Alph, etc.</p>

    <p>To create a new type of leader, please follow the <a href="mob_type.html">making object types tutorial</a>.</p>

    <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
    
    <p>A leader is any character that the player controls directly. When there are multiple leaders in the area, the player can swap between them. Leaders can whistle Pikmin into their group, throw them, punch, dismiss, etc.</p>

    <p>Leader objects are hardcoded in the engine to be controlled by the player's input and to have "active" and "inactive" states, depending on whether the player is controlling them right now or not. They can idle, whistle, punch, hold a Pikmin or another leader, throw it, dismiss, spray around, flinch or get knocked back when hurt, die, follow a group, pluck, sleep, be held and thrown, and drink a drop.</p>

    <p>If you're creating a new Pikmin type, you may want to add it to the correct spot in the <a href="game_config.html">game configuration</a>'s Pikmin order.</p>

    <h2 id="script">Script</h2>
    
    <p>Leader types have hardcoded <a href="script.html">scripts</a>, so the only thing you can do is enhance them.</p>

    <p>Some <a href="script.html#vars">script variables</a> control special behavior, like the leader's starting team. To know which ones exist, you can go to the area editor, select a leader, and read the tooltip of each variable.</p>
