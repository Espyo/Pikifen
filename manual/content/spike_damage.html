    <p>"Spike damage" is a mechanic where objects that suffered damage can immediately retaliate by damaging their attacker. In the <i>Pikmin</i> games, this is used by a White Pikmin to release poison to the enemy that ate it, in order to cause poison damage. In the engine, the same can be done, but any object can retaliate in any way, whether it is swallowed or damaged normally.</p>

    <p>The folders <code>game_data/&lt;<a href="making.html#packs">pack</a>&gt;/spike_damage_types</code> control the types of spike damage that exist in the game. Each <a href="making.html#data-file">data file</a> represents one type of spike damage, and the properties inside control how it works. Each one is also a piece of <a href="making.html#content">content</a>, so you should know how content works in the engine in general before starting.</p>

    <p>Once you finish setting up your spike damage types, remember to change the object type properties for the objects you want to deal this spike damage, as well as the different spike damage vulnerability modifiers, as explained <a href="mob_type.html">here</a>.</p>

    <p>The follow spike damage type properties exist:</p>

    <h3 id="props-common">Common</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>All of the <a href="making.html#content-props">common content properties</a>.</li>
    </ul>

      <tr>
        <td>ingestion_only</td>
