    <p>The <b>custom object</b> category is for any object that doesn't require a specific behavior. This is where you'd place a completely custom object, like say, a rubber ball that bounces around when a Pikmin is thrown at it, but is not meant to do anything specific, like be carried. This category also contains popular, but simple objects, like eggs, gates, obstacles, Pellet Posies, boulders, etc.</p>

    <p>To create a new type of custom object, please follow the <a href="mob_type.html">making object types tutorial</a>.</p>

    <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

    <p>The behavior of custom type objects is controlled entirely by the <a href="script.html">script</a>.</p>

    <h2 id="props">Properties</h2>

    <h3 id="props-common">Common</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>All of the <a href="mob_type.html#creating">common object type properties</a>.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="animations">Animations</h2>

    <p>Custom object types do not need any specific animations, only the ones that you call in the script.</p>

    <h2 id="script">Script</h2>

    <p>All of the custom type object's behavior is defined by the user-made <a href="script.html">script</a>. There are no recommended states, events, or actions.</p>

    <p>Some <a href="script.html#vars">script variables</a> control special behavior, like the object's starting team. To know which ones exist, you can go to the area editor, select a custom-type object, and read the tooltip of each variable.</p>
