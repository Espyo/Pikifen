    <p>The following is an explanation of the player options in <i>Pikifen</i>.</p>

    <p>All options saved by the game can be found in the <code>user_data/options.txt</code> file. You can edit this <a href="making.html#data-file">data file</a> manually, though it's more comfortable to try to change these options in the options menu, or in the respective editor's options menu. Some options can't be found in either of those, since they are too niche or complex to show in-game, and need to be changed manually. Some others can be changed in-game, but you may want more customized values, in which case you'll have to edit them by hand too. If you want to find options that affect performance, just use your browser's "find" feature to search for <code>performance</code> in this page! The following options exist, organized into different blocks:</p>

    <h2 id="advanced">Advanced</h2>

    <p>Advanced options that most players will not need to change.</p>
