    <b>Enemies</b> are any type of object that can attack or be attacked by the Pikmin.

    <p>Examples of enemy types include Red Bulborbs, Water Dumples, White Spectralids, etc.</p>

    <p>To create a new type of enemy, please follow the <a href="mob_type.html">making object types tutorial</a>.</p>

    <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

    <p>An enemy is something that a Pikmin will consider an opponent, and will want to attack. Depending on how the enemy is scripted, it can also want to attack the Pikmin, run away from them, ignore them, etc. Once killed, an enemy can drop a corpse, which can then be carried to an Onion to give Pikmin seeds. Because enemies can have many varied behaviors, most of what they do is controlled by the script.</p>
