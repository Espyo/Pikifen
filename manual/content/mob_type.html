  <div id="page-content">
    
    <p>This page will instruct you on how to make object types in <i>Pikifen</i>. These include types of enemies, types of Pikmin, etc.</p>

    <h2 id="idea">General idea</h2>
    
    <p>In order for the engine to detect a type of object, it will check the <code>game_data/&lt;<a href="making.html#packs">pack</a>&gt;/mob_types</code> folders. Inside are several subfolders, one for each category of object (enemies, gates, etc.). Inside each category are folders for the different types of objects (the different types of enemies, different types of leaders, etc.). Each type here is a <a href="making.html#content">piece of content</a>, so you should know how content works in the engine in general before starting. Finally, inside those are some <a href="making.html#data-file">data file</a> with data about how the object works, its animations, or its script.</p>

    <h2 id="creating">Creating a new object type</h2>
    
    <p>To create a new object type, make a folder for it in the right category, with the folder's name representing the object type's <a href="making.html#content">internal name</a>. Create an empty <a href="making.html#data-file">data file</a> inside called <code>data.txt</code>. Inside of that, you will write all of the object's properties, like the name, its movement speed, etc.</p>

    <p>Some properties are mandatory, some are optional, some apply to all object types, and some only apply to certain categories of object type. You can get a list of properties that apply to all object types in the following sub-sections of this page, and then check what properties exist for that category by visiting the category's article from the <a href="#mob-categories">list</a>. After you're done setting the properties, you must create the animations for the object type; use the <a href="animation.html">animation tutorial</a> for this. Finally, some object types will also need a script to run. To figure out if your object will need a script or not, check the <a href="#mob-categories">list of categories</a> and if it does, read the <a href="script.html">object script tutorial</a> to learn what you need to do.</p>

    <p>After you have done that, you can boot up the engine, go to the area editor, place your new object in an area, hit play, and watch it in action!</p>

    <p>Naturally, instead of creating your own files from scratch, you may copy and paste an existing object's files and simply edit those.</p>

    <h3 id="common-props">Common content properties</h3>
    
    <p>See <a href="making.html#content-props">here</a> for a list of basic properties a mob type can use. For the description, this should be written from a gameplay perspective, not a content-making perspective, so describe the object how it works in-game, not how it should be used in areas or with other objects. This description is useful for whoever reads the data file, but also shows up in the area editor, and in the case of Pikmin types, the help menu. You can use <code>\n</code> to cause a line break and start a new line. To write a literal backslash, you will need to type <code>\\</code>.</p>

    <h3 id="recommended-props">Recommended properties</h3>
    
    <p>The following are properties that you really should have, but the engine can run without them.</p>

    <p>If there's a type of object you know is popular in the <i>Pikmin</i> series, but you can't find the category for it, then either an appropriate category does not yet exist in the engine, or it can be created as a custom object.</p>

    <h3 id="reaches">Reaches</h3>

    <p>An object can detect whether another object is "within reach" or not. Also, if it was within reach, and became "out of reach". It can also use different definitions of "reach" for different moments. This is all explained in detail in the <a href="script.html#reach">script page</a>.</p>
    
    <h3 id="spawning">Spawning other objects</h3>
    
    <p>If you want your object to spawn other objects, you need to specify their spawn data. In <code>data.txt</code>, include a block titled <code>spawns</code>. Inside, you will write a series of blocks, each one with a unique name that will identify that spawn data. Later, when you want to spawn an object using the <a href="script.html">script</a>, you need to refer to this name.</p>

    <p>These spawn data blocks must have the following properties inside:</p>

    <h3 id="parent">Parent/child objects</h3>
    
    <p>Your object can be a <b>parent</b> object, meaning it is actually composed of several different <b>child</b> objects. This feature is especially useful when you need several independently-moving parts. For instance, in a <a href="https://www.pikminwiki.com/Beady_Long_Legs">Beady Long Legs</a>, the head is the parent object, meaning it is the enemy proper, and each leg is a child object.</p>

    <p>A parent will spawn its children at the same time that it itself is spawned. Because every child is meant to be its own individual thing but also serve as components of the parent object, there are several ways for you to specify what it should do when it interacts with the world. This means specifying what happens when it receives damage, receives a script event, or receives a status effect: it can either ignore what it received or not, and it can either relay it to the parent object or not.</p>

    <p>Children objects can also be connected to a specific body part in the parent. Because children objects are commonly used as appendages of the creature, it is possible to draw a "limb" connecting a parent object to a child object. This limb is a rectangular shaped sprite that stretches and rotates accordingly.</p>

    <p>To make your object type a parent, go to <code>data.txt</code>, and add a block called <code>children</code>. Inside, you will include a series of blocks, each one with a unique name that represents the child, e.g. "left_foot". Now, when your object is spawned, it will spawn these children along with it. Each of these children blocks needs to have the following properties:</p>

    <table class="props-t props-t-m">
      <tr>
        <td>spawn</td>
        <td>Name of the <a href="#spawning">spawn data</a> to use.</td>
        <td>Text</td>
      </tr>

    <h3 id="vulnerabilities">Vulnerabilities</h3>
    
    <p>You can make it so that an object is completely invulnerable to a hazard, more vulnerable to another, etc.</p>

    <p>In <code>data.txt</code>, add a block titled <code>vulnerabilities</code>. Inside, each property has the hazard's internal name as its name, and the vulnerability data as its value, e.g. <code>fire = 50 sweating true</code>. The vulnerability data consists of one to three words:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>The first word is the effect percentage. When the object is hurt by an attack with this hazard, its damage will be changed by the specified percentage, so 50 would make it take half damage. You can make this negative to get the object to heal instead! This value also affects some other things about the hazard's status effects, like speed reductions. If this value is 0, the object will completely ignore this hazard in its entirety, even if it's not an attack.</li>
      <li>The second word, optional, is the internal name of a status effect. When the object interacts with this hazard, it will receive this status effect.</li>
      <li>The third word, also optional, controls whether the status effect overrides others. If <code>true</code>, then the object will <i>only</i> receive the status effect from the previous word, and will not receive the status effect the hazard usually gives. If <code>false</code> or not specified, then the object will <i>also</i> receive this status effect on top of any others the hazard gives.</li>

    <h3 id="area-editor-tips">Area editor tips</h3>
    
    <p>Some objects require certain things to be set up in certain ways in the area editor before they work as intended. e.g. bridge fragment piles need to know what bridge they belong to, seesaw blocks need to link to each other before they work together, etc. Users who are not very familiar with these tricks may take a while to realize what's wrong. To help with this, you can also specify a property that, when read by the area editor, will make it so users can place their mouse over a text widget, and they will see some helpful tips about how to make use of the object.</p>
    
    <p>In <code>data.txt</code>, add a property titled <code>area_editor_tips</code>. Then, simply write the tip(s) you want as the value. You can use <code>\n</code> to cause a line break and start a new line. To write a literal backslash, you will need to type <code>\\</code>.</p>

    <p>You can also add the <code>area_editor_recommend_links_from</code> property and give it the value <code>true</code> so that the area editor warns whenever the maker places this object and it has no links going from it to another object. Likewise, the <code>area_editor_recommend_links_to</code> property makes the editor warn when there are no objects linking to it.</p>
    
    <h3 id="area-editor-props">Area editor properties</h3>
    
    <p>Some object types can make use of <a href="script.html#vars">script variables</a> to make specific objects have different behavior. For instance, with script variables, you can place two Pellet Posies in an area, and one of them can start already fully bloomed. When an object spawns, the engine itself or the object's script may read any declared script variables and use them as they see fit. In the area editor, you can write down the script variables you want a specific object to declare, along with their values, but having to memorize the names of the variables &ndash; as well as what each value means &ndash; is a bit of a pain. To remedy this, you can add some properties to the object type's data with information about important script variables. Then, when the area editor loads, it will use that information to present the user with some helpful widgets to set those special behaviors with, each widget in charge of one script variable.</p>
    
    <p>In <code>data.txt</code>, add a block titled <code>area_editor_properties</code>. Inside, you will write one block per script variable, with each block's name being the display text of the widget responsible. Then, add the following properties:</p>

    <table class="props-t props-t-m">
      <tr>
        <td>var</td>

        If objects of your new type are not being hunted down or hurt, confirm the following:
        <ul>
          <li>The object's target type is one of the types the attacker wants to hunt or can hurt.</li>
          <li>The object is not in the same team as the attacker.</li>
          <li>The object has more than zero health.</li>
          <li>The object is not unhuntable via the <code><a href="events_and_actions.html#set-huntable">set_huntable</a></code> <a href="script.html">script action</a>.</li>
          <li>The object is not invisible via a <a href="status.html">status effect</a>.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>If you're having trouble understanding why your custom object is acting the way it is, try aiming your cursor at it and using the "mob info" <a href="maker_toolkit.html">maker tool</a> (5 key, by default).</li>
      <li>Avoid making carriable objects with more than 95 units of radius. Gates and most choke points typically have a gap of 192 units, so larger objects likely won't fit through.</li></li>
