    <h1>Pre-packaged content</h1>
    
    <p>Although you can make a <i>lot</i> of content in <i>Pikifen</i>, the engine already comes with some pre-packaged content for you to play with right off the bat. In general, the pre-packaged content is based on the official Pikmin types, leaders, enemies, etc., so it's normal to have some of these in content that you or other people make. This page will explain some of the most important elements of this content.</p>

    <h2 id="sprays">Obstacles</h2>

    <p>Only the most noteworthy obstacles will be listed.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Clogs are large stones that can be broken to drain a body of water.</li>
      <li>Crystals can contain other things inside. Breaking the crystal frees its contents.</li>
      <li>Reinforced walls cannot be destroyed by Pikmin directly. Instead, try placing a bomb rock next to them.</li>
      <li>Bamboo gates have handles at the top, and can be lifted into the air by Winged Pikmin.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2 id="sprays">Other objects</h2>

    <p>Only the most noteworthy objects will be listed.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Pellet Posies have numbered pellets on them. Take down the plant to free the pellet.</li>
      <li>Eggs usually have nectar inside, but if you're lucky, they can drop some spray drops.</li>
      <li>Flukeweeds look like spiraling plants, and usually hide something underneath their roots. Winged Pikmin can pull these plants out.</li>
      <li>You can push down one seesaw block to raise the equivalent one, as long as that one doesn't have more weight on it.</li>
      <li>Bomb rocks can be picked up by any Pikmin. Throwing a Pikmin with a bomb rock will make it drop it and start its fuse. You can also let a bomb rock Pikmin get bit by an enemy, so that the enemy eats the bomb rock instead and leaves the Pikmin unharmed.</li>
      <li>Climbing sticks can be used by Pikmin to reach higher terrain. Some climbing sticks may start their life as a pile of twigs, and Pikmin must make them into a full stick first.</li>
      <li>Bouncy Mushrooms will throw Pikmin or leaders that land on top of them towards a fixed destination.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="sprays">Sprays</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>Ultra-spicy spray can be applied on the current group of Pikmin, making them all faster at moving, and faster at striking enemies and tasks.</li>
      <li>Ultra-bitter spray can be used on any enemy in front of the leader to instantly petrify it. The enemy will have a bit more defense, but will also be completely unable to move until it breaks free.</li>
    </ul>
