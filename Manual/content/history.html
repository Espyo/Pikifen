    <h2 id="creation">Creation</h2>
    
    <p>The idea for the engine started on mid 2013, with the intent of both allowing <i>Pikmin</i> fans to make their own games reality as well as to create a fun and challenging <i>Pikmin</i>-related project. The idea was made public on Pikmin Fanon, where <a href="https://www.pikminfanon.com/wiki/Topic:Pikmin_Engine_by_Espyo">a topic</a> was created to gather feedback, before starting the project. On the 15th of August, 2013, development of the engine officially began. Ever since, different versions have been released, each one more complete than the last.</p>
    
    <p>On February 2nd, 2018, the project got rebranded, and the mission statement changed a bit. Instead of it being called "Pikmin fangame engine", it got renamed to "<i>Pikifen</i>", and the idea was no longer to make fangames a reality, since that proved to be too ambitious at best, and outright impossible at worst. Instead, the goal became to create a fun engine in which people could create and play their own content, and the idea to make full games in it being secondary.</p>
