    <h1>Object category &ndash; Pikmin</h1>
    
    <p>The <b>Pikmin</b> are the creatures the player controls. They can carry, fight, multiply, get eaten, etc.</p>

    <p>Examples of Pikmin include Red Pikmin, Yellow Pikmin, Purple Pikmin, etc.</p>

    <p>To create a new type of Pikmin, please follow the <a href="mob_type.html">creating object types tutorial</a>.</p>

    <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
    
    <p>The Pikmin are programmed to do a lot of things in the engine, and the player can edit several of their properties to create Pikmin resistant to various things, and with different strengths and weaknesses.</p>

    <p>Pikmin type objects are hardcoded in the engine to be shot out as a seed from an Onion, be a sprout on the floor, get plucked by a leader, follow a leader in a formation, be thrown, get dismissed, idle, chase an opponent, sigh when giving up on something, carry something, return to a pile of carriable objects, attacking while on the floor or latched on, be grabbed by an enemy, get knocked down, become paralyzed, flail around, panic around, drink a drop, and carry a tool. Pretty much all of the Pikmin's behavior comes from what is in the engine's code, and is too complex to do via scripting, so Pikmin do not support user-made scripting.</p>

    <h2 id="props">Properties</h2>
    
    <p>Besides the <a href="mob_type.html#creating">global object type properties</a>, a Pikmin type has the following properties.</p>

    <p>Note that if you want your Pikmin to be resistant to a certain hazard, you'll want to use the <a href="mob_type.html#vulnerabilities">vulnerabilities</a> properties. Another thing to note when making Pikmin is that the movement speed property indicates the movement speed of a leaf Pikmin. Bud Pikmin move 110% faster, and flowers move 120% faster.</p>
