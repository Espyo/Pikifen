    <p>Here are some tips for the engine!</p>
    
    <h2 id="general">Gameplay</h2>

    <h3 id="general-basic">Basic</h3>
    
    <ul>
      <li>Idle Pikmin will work on nearby tasks automatically.</li>
      <li>If you have no Pikmin with you, pressing the throw button will instead throw a punch. Use this to cause some damage to enemies.</li>
      <li>If you lie down, any nearby idle Pikmin will pick you up and carry you to an Onion without you doing anything. Take the opportunity to swap to a different leader and do something else while the lying one makes its way to base.</li>
      <li>If a Pikmin is dying because of some hazard, don't panic! You might be able to whistle them to help them out.</li>
      <li>Pikmin will take the shortest path available to their destination. If a barrier is blocking a shorter path, consider taking it down.</li>
      <li>Leaders aim with their cursor. If you are playing with a mouse, it will match your own mouse cursor (represented by a small spinning shape), but while the mouse cursor can move anywhere on-screen freely, the leader's cursor is limited in range. Be careful not to assume your leader will aim at your mouse cursor when it is far away!</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 id="general-advanced">Advanced</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>To drop a held Pikmin without throwing it, keep the throw button held, and press the whistle button.</li>
      <li>If you dismiss while swarming in a certain direction, the group will be dismissed in that direction.</li>
      <li>Your Pikmin actually have health. Though it slowly goes back up on its own, Pikmin that have been recently burned, poisoned, etc. will survive for less time if it happens again!</li>
      <li>If a Pikmin got knocked back, is lying on the floor, and about to be attacked, whistle it to make it get up faster.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="making">Making content</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>If you're having trouble understanding why your custom mob is acting the way it is, try enabling the <a href="maker_toolkit.html">maker tools</a>, aiming your cursor at it and using the "mob info" maker tool (5 key, by default).</li>
      <li>See <a href="area_tips.html">area tips</a> for tips on how to make good areas.</li>
      <li>If you've made changes to a <a href="making.html#data-file">data file</a>, you don't need to close the engine to test your changes (with a few exceptions). Simply reload the current area.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="misc">Misc.</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>Press F1 during gameplay to toggle the framerate visualizer.</li>
      <li>Press F12 to take a screenshot. It gets saved in the <code>User_data</code> folder.</li>
    </ul>
