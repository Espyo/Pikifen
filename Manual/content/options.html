    <p>The following is an explanation of the player options in <i>Pikifen</i>.</p>

    <p>All options saved by the game can be found in the <code>/User_data/Options.txt</code> file. You can edit this <a href="making.html#data-file">data file</a> manually, though it's more comfortable to try to change these options in the options menu, or in the respective editor's options menu. Some options can't be found in either of those, since they are too niche or complex to show in-game, and need to be changed manually. The following options can be found in the file, though the player controls are also saved here, but aren't listed in this table for simplicity's sake:</p>
