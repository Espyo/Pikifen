    <p>This page explains how to use and set up the maker toolkit on <i>Pikifen</i> &ndash; a set of tools that help while making content for the engine.</p>

    <h2 id="context">Context</h2>
    
    <p>Most of these tools are used while playing the engine, and are called by pressing the F keys (F2, F3, etc.), or the number keys (the ones above the letter keys). Their effects vary, but their purpose is to help content makers by making mundane tasks easier and providing helpful information, useful in debugging any problems. It is possible to set which tools run on which key, and it's also possible to change some of the tools's settings. There are also some other tools that are not run on demand.</p>

    <p>You can hold down the key to repeat the effect over and over. This is useful, for instance, to spawn several Pikmin quickly. It might stop working if you press another key while holding that one down, though. Some tools print out information on the top of the screen, on top of a see-through black box. This info disappears after some seconds, unless you call it again. F1 and F12 cannot be set as tool keys since they toggle the system info and take a screenshot, respectively.</p>

    <h2 id="config">Configuration file</h2>
    
    <p>First of all, open <code>User_data/Tools.txt</code>. This <a href="making.html#data-file">data file</a> will contain the information for the toolkit to work. The remainder of this section will explain what each line does, so if any of the properties listed are missing, add them yourself.</p>

    <p>The <code>enabled</code> property controls whether or not the toolkit is enabled.</p>

    <p>Afterwards, there are the <code>f1</code>, <code>f2</code>, etc. properties, all the way up to <code>f11</code>, as well as the <code>0</code> to <code>9</code> properties. These properties specify what tool to run when that key is pressed, if any. The value of these properties should be the tool's ID; to know a tool's ID, check its section in this article.</p>

    <p>Finally, this file can also contain settings for some of the tools. Read a tool's section in this article to learn more about what settings it has.</p>

    <h2 id="key-tools">Key tools</h2>
    
    <h3 id="area-image">Area image</h3>
    
    <p>Creates an image of the entire area and saves it in the <code>User_data</code> folder. This is a great way to show other people what your area is like. This draws the area just as it appears in-game, so with the objects and shadows and everything. The HUD won't be visible, though. How zoomed in or out the area is when compared to how it looks in-game depends on the size of the image. It is recommended that you don't try to aim for a 1:1 zoom level, but instead focus on having an image big enough for people to understand what is happening, but not so big that it is a pain to open.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Tool ID: <code>area_image</code>.</li>
      <li>
        Settings:
        <ul>
          <li><code>area_image_size</code>: Maximum image width or height, in pixels. 2048 is a good size for medium or large areas, otherwise 1024 works fine. Defaults to 2048.</li>
          <li><code>area_image_mobs</code>: Set to true or false depending on whether or not you want to see objects, particle effects, etc. Defaults to true.</li>
          <li><code>area_image_shadows</code>: Set to true or false depending on whether or not you want to see tree leaf shadows. Defaults to true.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3 id="speed">Change speed</h3>
    
    <p>Changes the game's flow of time, making it faster or slower. Press the tool's key while playing to switch from normal speed to the set speed, and then press again to return to normal. If you're testing something tedious, speeding up the gameplay means you have to wait less, and if you're trying to understand what is happening in a scenario that goes by too quickly, you can slow the game down. Note that the engine wasn't meant to run at these speeds, so some behaviors might not work properly, like objects being able to clip through walls they normally wouldn't.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Tool ID: <code>change_speed</code>.</li>
      <li>
        Settings:
        <ul>
          <li><code>change_speed_multiplier</code>: Game speed multiplier. 1 is normal speed, 0.5 is half speed, 2.0 is double speed, etc. Defaults to 2.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3 id="geometry-info">Geometry info</h3>
    
    <p>Prints out geometry info about what's under the cursor (or stops if pressed again), on the top of the screen. It uses the mouse cursor for this, not the leader's cursor. This prints out the cursor's coordinates, as well as some basic info about the sector that the cursor is on: its height and texture.</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>Tool ID: <code>geometry_info</code>.</li>
      <li>Settings: none.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 id="hurt-mob">Hurt mob</h3>
    
    <p>Hurts the mob closest to the cursor. This is the mouse cursor, not the leader cursor. It saps away some half of its health every time you press it, meaning you can kill anything with just two presses (or more, if it regenerates). It's useful to kill troublesome enemies or boring obstacles without having to deal with them. Note that if you hold down the key, you'll be able to kill several mobs quickly, but if you don't pay attention, you could end up killing an object you didn't mean to, like your leader. To note also is that the mob does not receive any damage-related event with this, so it will never react to having lost health, even if its script says it should. It will die normally, however.</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>Tool ID: <code>hurt_mob</code>.</li>
      <li>
        Settings:
        <ul>
          <li><code>mob_hurting_percentage</code>: How much of the mob's total health should be lost each time. 50 is 50%, 100 will kill any mob instantly, etc. Defaults to 50.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3 id="mob-info">Mob info</h3>
    
    <p>Prints out important information about the mob closest to the cursor, on the top of the screen. It uses the mouse cursor for this, not the leader's cursor. When you press the button, it locks-on to that mob, and only unlocks if the mob is deleted or if you press the button again while pointing to the same mob. Pointing to a different mob will lock to that one instead. The information shown is:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li><b>Name</b>: The name of the type of mob this is (e.g. Red Bulborb, Olimar).</li>
      <li><b>Coords</b>: The mob's current coordinates, separated by space. The third coordinate is the Z, which means its vertical position.</li>
      <li><b>State hist.</b>: Name of the script states it has gone through (up to 4). The current one is the first on the list.</li>
      <li><b>Health</b>: Current health amount.</li>
      <li><b>Timer</b>: Time left on the currently running script timer, if any.</li>
      <li><b>Animation</b>: Name of the current playing animation, if any.</li>
      <li><b>Vars</b>: Name and value of all script variables.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>As such, the information shown is mostly useful to debug scripts and animations. </p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>Tool ID: <code>mob_info</code>.</li>
      <li>Settings: none.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 id="new-pikmin">New Pikmin</h3>
    
    <p>Creates a new Pikmin where the cursor is, in the idle state. This uses the mouse cursor, not the leader's cursor. The type of the Pikmin created depends on the previous Pikmin created this way, in that it follows a cycle, alphabetically going through all Pikmin types declared on the engine. The new Pikmin will also have flower maturity. This tool is very useful if you need more Pikmin with you instantly. You can hold down the key to create a large army of Pikmin in a short time.</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>Tool ID: <code>new_pikmin</code>.</li>
      <li>Settings: none.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3 id="hitboxes">Show hitboxes</h3>
    
    <p>Toggles visibility of mob hitboxes in-game. For each mob that has hitboxes, they will appear overlaid on top of it, and with a color scheme similar to the animation editor (green for hitboxes that can be damaged, red for those currently causing damage, and yellow for ignored ones).</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Tool ID: <code>hitboxes</code>.</li>
      <li>Settings: none.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 id="teleport">Teleport</h3>
    
    <p>Teleports the current leader to the cursor's position. This uses the mouse cursor, not the leader's cursor. Use this to go somewhere instantly or to move around the area quickly. Keep in mind that Pikmin in your party will not teleport with you, so they may have a hard time following you. This also has some technical drawbacks: Pikmin may go to an incorrect spot when trying to stay on the group, and the leader's vertical position may not be updated correctly. Neither of these are critical and eventually fix themselves. You can also hold down the key to repeatedly go to the cursor, which updates with the leader, meaning that this allows you to quickly move through everything in the direction the cursor is. This is however very hard to control.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Tool ID: <code>teleport</code></li>
      <li>Settings: none.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="others">Other tools</h2>
    
    <h3 id="auto-start">Auto start</h3>
    
    <p>If you find yourself opening the engine, going to the same game mode, menu, or area every time, closing down, and repeating the process over and over, you can use this tool to avoid that. It makes the engine start on something other than the main menu automatically, and also optionally automatically open a specific area or animation.</p>

    <p>The <code>auto_start_mode</code> variable controls what mode to automatically start on. If left empty, the engine boots to the main menu as usual. Valid values are <code>play</code>, <code>animation_editor</code>, <code>area_editor</code>, or <code>gui_editor</code>. The <code>auto_start_option</code> variable contains the area or animation to load on the game or editor, optionally. For areas, this is the path to the area's folder from the engine's folder. For animations it's the same, but the path to the data file. For GUIs, it's just the name of the GUI's data file.</p>

    <p>You can also press Ctrl+F12 in the engine to set the auto-start mode and option to the current mode and currently opened content. Pressing that outside of any of the recognized modes will set both values to empty.</p>
    
    <h3 id="perf-mon">Performance monitor</h3>
    
    <p>When you enter an area, the engine loads a lot of content, and does a lot processing to get the gameplay state ready. This procedure takes a few seconds. If you suspect some of your content is causing the load times to be too high, you can use the performance monitor to find out how long the engine takes on each part of the area loading procedure. Likewise, while playing, the engine needs to process and draw several different things. If the framerate (press F1) is low or unstable, and you suspect some of your content is to blame, the performance monitor can help you here too.</p>
    
    <p>The <code>performance_monitor</code> property controls whether the monitor is on or off. If you don't need it, keep it off, since it can slow the game down! When you turn it on, any area you enter will be monitored. When you quit, the engine will generate a performance report about the area's loading procedure, and the frames of gameplay. The report can be found in <code>User_data/Performance_log.txt</code>.</p>
    
    <p>The data for each recorded area is split into four parts. The first is the loading times; with this, you can tell how long the engine took to load the particle generator info, the HUD settings, the weather data, etc. For object types, it will also split the measurements by each category of object type. Besides that, the log will also show how long it took to process the different parts of the area generation procedure. All of this information can help you realize what's making your area take so long to load &ndash; maybe it has too many objects, maybe its sectors are too complex, or maybe your pellet graphics are just too high-resolution.</p>
    
    <p>The other three parts of the report refer to the framerate. The second part measures how long the average frame takes to process and draw on-screen, while the third and fourth parts report the fastest frame you had, and the slowest, respectively. This difference can be useful in figuring out if something during gameplay is causing severe frame drops. In these reports, the log will tell you how long the engine takes to completely process one frame, measuring how long it takes to process all particles, object physics, etc., as well as how long it takes to draw the background, world components, HUD, and so on. With this data, you may come to a conclusion about what's making your framerate be so low, or so unstable &ndash; maybe your area has too many objects colliding against each other, maybe one of your enemy scripts is too heavy when doing some specific calculation, or maybe you just have way too many tree shadows.</p>
