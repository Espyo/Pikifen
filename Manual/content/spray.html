    <p>This page will guide you in making spray types for <i>Pikifen</i>.</p>

    <h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
    
    <p>Whenever a leader uses a spray, they spray a bunch of particles in a given direction, and certain objects, dictated by the rules of the spray, will befall under some status effect. A status effect can make them faster (like an ultra-spicy spray), or make them stop on their tracks (like an ultra-bitter spray), amongst other things. Before creating sprays, you must have some status effect definitions. If you don't, please read the <a href="status.html">status effects guide</a> for information on how to create some.</p>

    <p>Spray definitions can be found in the <code>Game_data/&lt;<a href="making.html#packages">package</a>&gt;/Sprays</code> folder. Every <a href="making.html#data-file">data file</a> here defines a spray, and the file's name is not important.</p>

    <h2 id="props">Properties</h2>
    
    <p>Every spray file has these properties:</p>

    <h3 id="props-common">Common</h3>

      <li>All of the <a href="making.html#content-props">common content properties</a>.</li>

        <td>How far the spray reaches in angle, in degrees. If a spray is only meant to hit directly in front of the leader, this should be very small, but if it's meant to also hit half a circle in front of the leader, it can be 180.</td>

    <p>If you're creating a new spray type, you may want to add it to the correct spot in the <a href="misc_config.html">game configuration</a>'s spray order.</p>
