    <p>To play, just choose the "Play" option from the main menu and pick an area, really.</p>
    <p>In-game, you are allowed to control the leaders and play around like in the canon <i>Pikmin</i> games. At the moment, the concept of an "end" is nothing more than the Sun Meter reaching the end, or you losing all leaders, so the engine is more of a sandbox in terms of gameplay. You can check the controls by going to the options menu from the main menu, or by reading the help page of the in-game pause menu.</p>
    <p>The minimum requirements to run the engine aren't that high; old machines should run it just fine without many performance problems. But it does depend on what is going on: a simple area with just a leader will run much better than a complex area with 100 Pikmin on the field. Some <a href="options.html">options</a> can be set to help with performance, at the cost of appearance, while others just tweak the experience based on your preferences.</p>
    <p>Though the idea of <i>Pikifen</i> is for you to create your own content, you can still play around with the content that comes pre-packaged with the engine. Because that content is based on the most important things in the canon games, it's normal to have some of it present in content you or others make.</p>

    <h2 id="gameplay"><i>Pikmin</i> gameplay</h2>

    <p>It's strongly recommended that you play the official <i>Pikmin</i> games, both to support Nintendo, and to more easily understand what to do in <i>Pikifen</i>. The gameplay concepts, mechanics, and rules can be figured out by experimenting, playing the official games, or by reading the the help page of the in-game pause menu.</p>
    
    <p>The gameplay mechanics apply to the entirety of <i>Pikifen</i>, regardless of what content you're playing, though some content may have more unusual goals or gimmicks, and require you to play a bit differently.</p>
