    <p>To play, just choose the "Play" option from the main menu and pick an area, really.</p>
    <p>In-game, you are allowed to control the leaders and play around like in the canon <i>Pikmin</i> games. At the moment, the concept of an "end" is nothing more than the Sun Meter reaching the end, or you losing all leaders, so the engine is more of a sandbox in terms of gameplay. You can check the controls by going to the options menu from the main menu.</p>
    <p>The minimum requirements to run the engine aren't that high; old machines should run it just fine without many performance problems. But it does depend on what is going on: a simple area with just a leader will run much better than a complex area with 100 Pikmin on the field. Some <a href="options.html">options</a> can be set to help with performance, at the cost of appearance, while others just tweak the experience based on your preferences.</p>
    <p>Though the idea of <i>Pikifen</i> is for you to create your own content, you can still play around with the content that comes pre-packaged with the engine. Because that content is based on the most important things in the canon games, it's normal to have some of it present in content you or others make. If you need some tips with one of the included Pikmin, enemies, etc., see <a href="pre_packaged_content.html">here</a>.</p>

    <h2 id="gameplay"><i>Pikmin</i> gameplay</h2>

    <p>It's strongly recommended that you play the official <i>Pikmin</i> games, both to support Nintendo, and to more easily understand what to do in <i>Pikifen</i>. These gameplay concepts, mechanics, and rules apply to the entirety of <i>Pikifen</i>, regardless of what content you're playing, though some content may be wilder than normal, and require you to play a bit differently.</p>
    <p>The idea of <i>Pikmin</i> games, and as such, <i>Pikifen</i>, is to control a leader, and organize your Pikmin so that you can work towards your goal, which is usually collecting some important objects. Organization, planning, and multitasking are essential, considering that there are only so many hours within a day, and depending on the game, only so many days available for playing.</p>
    <p>Right now, there is no concept of "day" in the engine, nor is there an overarching goal, but the rush to get tasks done is still there. Depending on the area and your own interests, you may want to kill every enemy, collect every treasure, or do something else within the time limit of one day.</p>
    <p>For this, it is important to know how to use the Pikmin effectively. Any Pikmin that's idling about will stay in place and have a glow to it. You can whistle the Pikmin or bump into it to add it to your group, after which it will start following you. You can then order a Pikmin in your group to work on a task, battle an enemy, etc., by grabbing the Pikmin from your group and throwing it at your target.</p>
    <p>The more Pikmin in charge of a task, the more effective they will be, and the lower the risk of casualties in case an enemy fights back. But on the flip side, if you keep ordering all your Pikmin to work on the same thing, you will never get everything done in time. It is important that you learn to split your Pikmin forces, leaving some of them to work on opening a shortcut, letting others bring back spoils to the base, and commanding others in an enemy battle.</p>
    <p>Pikmin can die in combat, or by being harmed by a hazard. But more Pikmin can be grown, by having them bring enemy carcasses, or nutritious pellets, towards their Onion, which is usually located at base. The Onion will then produce more Pikmin, which need to be plucked by a leader.</p>
    <p>If there are multiple leaders available, it is also possible to swap between them. Leaving different leaders in different parts of the area allows you to manage different groups of Pikmin doing different things simultaneously. Different species of Pikmin exist, and some are better suited for some tasks than others, making it important to choose what Pikmin you want to throw next. For instance, Yellow Pikmin are immune to electricity, so they're recommended when you're fighting electrical enemies, and are an absolute must to take down electrified obstacles.</p>
    <p>The rest of the gameplay should be intuitive, like how each leader has health, and if they suffer too much damage, they are knocked out and can't be controlled any more, or how the act of throwing allows you to get Pikmin on otherwise inaccessible ledges. Other gameplay features include:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>You can order all Pikmin in the group to swarm in a certain direction, and work on whatever is there.</li>
      <li>You can dismiss all Pikmin into groups, separated by type.</li>
      <li>You can spray your group of Pikmin, or the enemy in front of you, to cause various buffs or nerfs.</li>
      <li>You can have other leaders in your group, and throw them to other places.</li>
      <li>You can investigate an Onion in order to manage how many Pikmin are safely stored inside, and how many are following you.</li>
      <li>The Onion that Pikmin bring something to depends on their carriers; the majority will bring the object to their Onion, if possible.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>There's much more to <i>Pikifen</i>, and you can figure it out by experimenting, playing the official games, or by reading the <a href="pre_packaged_content.html">pre-packaged content tips</a> or <a href="tips.html">general tips</a> pages.</p>
