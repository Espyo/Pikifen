      <dt><b>Animations are just static frames shown in quick succession.</b></dt>
      <dd>An <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animation">animation</a> is a collection of images that flip in quick succession to give the illusion of movement. For instance, for a Pikmin's attack animation, it would consist of an image (also called a <b>frame</b>) with the Pikmin clinging on, an image with it reeling its head back, an image with it swinging the head forward, and an image where the stem is smacking. By quickly flipping through these images, it gives the illusion that the Pikmin is animated.</dd>
      <dt><b>Frames come from sprites, which are reusable.</b><dt>
      <dd>Animations are made up of frames, an in the engine, each frame fetches information from a <b>sprite</b>. This is because, in order to save on space, an animation may reuse the same image multiple times. In the Bulborb example to the right, the "half-step right" image (#2) is used both after and before the "full-step right" image (#3). As such, there is only one sprite for the "half-step right", and two frames in the walking animation that make use of that same sprite.</dd>
      <dt><b>Objects have body parts, and these are represented in sprites via hitboxes.</b></dt>
      <dd>For each object, you can specify what body parts it's made of, and in each sprite, you can place different <b>hitboxes</b> (also known as hitbubbles), with each one matching a body part. This way, if a Pikmin is clinging on to the Bulborb's "back", the engine will know where to place the Pikmin at any moment, since the creature's back changes places during its animations. The fact that each body part is also represented by a hitbox means that for any given moment, you can specify if that body part can be damaged, latched-on to, or if its currently attacking or knocking Pikmin away, among other things.</dd>
    </dl>

    <h3 id="starting">Starting some animations</h3>
    
    <dl>
      <dt><b>You'll need a spritesheet &ndash; an image file with the sprite graphics within.</b></dt>
      <dd>Before beginning to animate an object, you must have some images to be used as the sprites. Although it is possible to place each image in a different file, it is a lot more efficient to have all (or most) images for the object within the same file. These are what are known as "spritesheets". For examples, see the spritesheets that come with the engine. You probably also want to actually have the object's data in the game's data (see the <a href="mob_type.html">object types tutorial</a>).</dd>
      <dt><b>Sprite images should be in a top-down perspective and show the object facing the right.</b></dt>
      <dd>During gameplay, the sprites as the object rotates, and they need to be facing to the right as the default position so the engine knows how to rotate.</dd>
      <dt><b>Notes:</b></dt>
      <dd><ul>
        <li>If your object is a recolor of an existing one, you can make a copy of the original object's spritesheet and use any painting program to change the colors.</li>
        <li>You can also edit the <a href="https://github.com/Espyo/Pikifen/tree/master/Documents/Vectorial%20graphics">SVG files</a> used for the prepackaged enemy graphics with a vectorial art editing program to change the color schemes.</li>

    <h3 id="using">Using the animation editor</h3>
    
    <dl>
      <dt><b>The left-hand side is your canvas.</b></dt>
      <dd>It shows you what the current sprite or animation looks like.</dd>
      <dt><b>The right-hand side contains panels for you to edit properties with.</b><dt>
      <dd>Depending on what you are editing, you can create body parts, choose a file for a sprite, set the timing for an animation's frame, etc.</dd>
      <dt><b>The bottom-left is the status bar. It can help if you get stuck.</b></dt>
      <dd>The status bar will let you know what just happened, whether an operation finished successfully, or something went wrong. If you're confused, check it out.</dd>
      <dt><b>In the canvas, the left mouse button can be used to adjust some properties too.</b></dt>
      <dd>For instance, if you're positioning a hitbox in a sprite, you can either use the panel to write the coordinates, or you can just drag the hitbox directly inside the canvas.</dd>
      <dt><b>Use the right mouse button to pan, and the mouse wheel to zoom.</b></dt>
      <dd>In the canvas, the right mouse button and mouse wheel control your view. Clicking and double-clicking the mouse wheel will also reset your zoom level and camera position, respectively.</dd>

    <h3 id="picking-file">Picking the animation file</h3>
    
    <p>For the sake of this tutorial, we'll be creating the animations for a Red Bulborb, using the prepackaged Red Bulborb spritesheet. For that, you should probably <a href="mob_type.html">create a new Red Bulborb enemy</a>, as you don't want to work on top of the existing enemy's animations; we're doing things from scratch.</p>
    
    <dl>
      <dt><b>Open the animation editor.</b></dt>
      <dd>To do so, from the engine's main menu, choose the "Animation editor" option.</dd>
      <dt><b>In the dialog, pick the object you are editing.</b></dt>
      <dd>When you boot the animation editor, you will be right away asked to pick an object to edit. There are multiple ways for you to select with, so go with the method you find most convenient. For this tutorial, pick your new enemy.</dd>
    </dl>
    
    <h3 id="body-part">Making a body part</h3>
    
    <p>Let's begin by creating the enemy's body parts.</p>

    <dl>
      <dt><b>Enter the body part panel.</b></dt>
      <dd>From the editor's main panel, click "Body parts", so that you may enter the body part control panel.</dd>
      <dt><b>To create a body part, click the "+" button, and then enter its name.</b></dt>
      <dd>For our Red Bulborb, what should the first body part be? The hitboxes that represent them are circles, and because the Bulborb is a very round creature, we could use one bubble for its entire body and call it a day. But it is also true that hitting a Bulborb on its back causes more damage than the front. So we'll need to distinguish between the head and the back. Finally, the Bulborb can grab Pikmin with its mouth, and the engine must be able to recognize the mouth as a body part that can capture Pikmin. So, create a <code>head</code> body part, then create a second one called <code>back</code>, and finally create <code>mouth</code>.</dd>
      <dt><b>When hitboxes overlap, the engine will prioritize body parts higher in the list.</b></dt>
      <dd>Because the hitboxes are bubbles, it will be nearly impossible to align them on an object without them overlapping, unless we leave a huge chunk of the object uncovered by hitboxes. If a Bulborb's "back" and "head" hitboxes overlap, what happens if a Pikmin hits both at once? How will the engine know which one to connect the Pikmin to? This is where that note written in the panel comes into play. The higher on the list, the higher a hitbox's priority for scenarios like that one.</dd>
      <dt><b>In the list, click and drag a body part to sort it.</b></dt>
      <dd>For the Bulborb, we will want the player to benefit from the extra damage bonus as much as possible, so it's fair that the back hitbox has higher priority when it comes to being picked in the case of a tie. Because the order we currently have is the head as #1 and the back as #2, you should drag the "back" body part to the top of the list.</dd>
    </dl>

    <h3 id="sprite">Making a sprite</h3>

    <p>You can now press the "Back" button to return to the main panel. From here, enter the "Sprites" mode so we may create our first sprite to be used in some frame in the future.</p>
    
    <dl>
      <dt><b>In the sprite panel, the large button at the top lets you choose/create a sprite.</b></dt>
      <dd>Since we have no sprite chosen, it should just read "(None)". Clicking on it will give you a list of sprites to choose from, but because there are none the list will be empty. There is however a textbox at the top which you can use to create a new one. Just give it a name &ndash; let's start with the most basic pose, which would be the idle position. Type <code>idle</code> for the name of this sprite.</dd>
      <dt><b>You can choose the graphics file in "Bitmap" mode.</b></dt>
      <dd>To specify what image represents this sprite, click the "Bitmap" button to enter the Bitmap panel. Use the "File" textbox to specify where the bitmap file is, so in other words, our spritesheet. You can also use the "..." button to browse for a file. To use the pre-packaged Red Bulborb spritesheet, we'll want <code>Red_Bulborb.png</code>.</dd>
      <dt><b>A sprite may use just a rectangular portion of the image. You can click on the canvas to select parts, with the help of the panel.</b></dt>
      <dd>To tell the engine exactly what part of this bitmap file constitutes the sprite we need, you can go to the panel and specify the coordinates (drag or double-click the widgets) of the top-left corner of the region, along with the width and height. Alternatively, you can click on that exact sprite in the canvas, and the editor will select that region for you. For our case, we want the Bulborb's idle pose, which is the one in the top-left corner. Now that the engine knows what image to use, when you back out, you should see the Bulborb's idle pose on the canvas.</dd>
      <dt><b>In "Transformation" mode, you can resize, flip, align, and rotate the sprite.</b></dt>
      <dd>This is useful, for example, with the pre-packaged Dwarf Red Bulborb, which simply uses the Red Bulborb graphics, but scales down every sprite to be the size of a Dwarf Red Bulborb. You can use the widgets in the panel to resize, as well as perform other transformation operations. You can also use the handles present on the canvas. The middle blue dot lets you move the sprite horizontally, the edge and corner dots let you resize, and the circle handle lets you rotate.</dd>
      <dt><b>The white plus-shaped lines in the canvas indicate where the center of the object is.</b></dt>
      <dd>When the object rotates, it does so around this point. As a general rule, this point should be located at the center of the creature's legs, so for the Red Bulborb, you should offset the sprite horizontally by 16 (drag or double-click the widget), so the object center is around the center of its backside.</dd>
      <dt><b>Notes:</b></dt>
      <dd><ul>
        <li>To make sure a sprite you're working on is aligned with previously-made sprites, you can use the "comparison sprite" tools in the panel.</li>
      </ul></dd>
    </dl>

    <h3 id="hitbox">Placing hitboxes</h3>
    
    <p>Our "idle" sprite is now good to be used in a frame of animation, except we need to clean up the hitboxes first.</p>
    
    <dl>
      <dt><b>The green (or yellow, or red) bubbles in the canvas are hitboxes, and each one represents a body part.</b></dt>
      <dd>When you make a new sprite, the engine just bundles up all hitboxes in the center of the sprite, which would explain the large green circle you see in the center.</dd>
      <dt><b>Use the "Hitboxes" mode to edit hitboxes. You can use the panel or canvas handles to move them.</b></dt>
      <dd>When in the "Hitboxes" mode, the currently-selected hitbox will have its information displayed on the panel, and will receive handles around it. Like with the sprite transformation handles, the central one lets you move the hitbox about. Naturally, you can also move it with the panel widgets (drag or double-click them). For our Red Bulborb, since all of the hitboxes are bundled into one spot, drag them away from one another.</dd>
      <dt><b>Select hitboxes by clicking on them. The name of the selected hitbox can be found in the top-right of the panel.</b></dt>
      <dd>You can click on a hitbox in the canvas to select it, as long as you don't click the blue handles! If hitboxes are overlapping, you can click in the same spot again to select the next one in that location. You can also use the left and right arrow buttons at the top of the panel to pick a different hitbox.</dd>
      <dt><b>Move and resize hitboxes to cover up the sprite.</b></dt>
      <dd>Of the three hitboxes, pick the one corresponding to the Bulborb's back, which we named "back", and move it to the Bulborb's back. Note how the hitbox doesn't cover up the creature's back that well, because the default hitbox size is just too small. So, you can resize it using the edge or corner handles in the canvas, or by editing the "Radius" widget (by dragging or double-clicking). With a radius of 50, the hitbox fits the Bulborb's backside just fine, so simply drag it into place after you're done changing its size.</dd>
      <dt><b>Hitboxes exist in 3D space. They have a Z coordinate (bottommost point), and a height, like a cylinder.</b></dt>
      <dd>Just like how the X and Y coordinates control where the hitbox is in space, the Z coordinate controls where it is vertically. A Z coordinate of 0 means it starts at ground level, and higher values make it float off the ground. For most enemies, you can keep it simple and leave all hitboxes to start at ground level, but if you want to create, say, a Beady Long Legs, the body's hitbox will need to be above ground, and this is where you'd change it. As for the height, if it is 0, that means the hitbox is infinitely tall. This is useful for the likes of gates, to make sure Pikmin can't be thrown past them. But other than that, to keep things simple, you will want to set a hitbox's height to the exact same height that your object has, if it's not already. In the Red Bulborb's case, that's 128.</dd>
      <dt><b>Notes:</b></dt>
      <dd><ul>
        <li>If you want to be meticulous, you could write more specific heights for each body part (for instance, the Bulborb's mouth is not as tall as its whole body, and starts higher above the ground). You can use the "Use side view" checkbox in the panel to get a side view representation of the object and the hitboxes, which is especially useful for this sort of task. Remember though: because the engine has no real side view, the object will simply be represented by a solid rectangle here. This side mode is just a visual aid, after all!</li>
        </ul></dd>
    </dl>
    
    <h3 id="hitbox-gameplay">Hitboxes in gameplay</h3>
    
    <dl>
      <dt><b>Normal hitboxes (green) can be attacked by another object's attack hitboxes (red).</b></dt>
      <dd>Now that the "back" hitbox's positioning is all set up, let's change how it works for combat. There are three radio buttons labeled as the "Hitbox type". Bulborbs can't attack with their backsides when idling, and their backs are definitely present on the "idle" pose, so it's neither an attack nor a disabled hitbox. So, the hitbox type to pick here is "Normal".</dd>
      <dt><b>Specific hitboxes can take more or less damage than usual, with the "defense multiplier", or be latched on by Pikmin.</b></dt>
      <dd>Remember how we want the backside to suffer extra damage from Pikmin attacks? We can set that in the defense multiplier. "1" means that hitbox has a defense of 100%, so it takes full damage, while "0.5" means the hitbox only has 50% defense, i.e. it suffers twice as much damage. "0.8" seems like a good value for this hitbox; remember to experiment when creating your own enemies. Before we move on to the next hitbox, check the "Pikmin can latch" checkbox because Pikmin are indeed meant to latch on to a Bulborb's back.</dd>
      <dt><b>Hitbox overlap is normal. Try to balance between good sprite coverage and little overlap.</b></dt>
      <dd>For our Red Bulborb, place and resize the "head" hitbox now. It will need to overlap with the "back" hitbox, so try to go for a good balance between covering the head graphics nicely, and not overlapping with the back too much. Try these coordinates for the "head" hitbox: 52 and 0 for the X and Y, and 40 for the radius. Also set the Z, height, hitbox type (also normal), and Pikmin latching option. Finally, you should leave the "head" hitbox's damage multiplier as 1, as it makes sense for the head to take a normal amount of damage.</dd>
      <dt><b>Disabled hitboxes (yellow) are useful for when you don't need them in this sprite.</b></dt>
      <dd>The Red Bulborb's mouth is the body part that will be able to hold captured Pikmin, so don't make it too big nor too small. A radius of 16 for this is enough. Place it in the general area of the mouth and fill in the other stats as usual. Now, do we really want the Pikmin to be able to attack the mouth? It's so small, and the bulk of the damage collisions happen on the creature's back and head, so the answer is no &ndash; by changing this hitbox's type to "disabled", we indicate that in an "idle" pose, the engine will not have to worry about the creature's mouth. Of course, other sprites (like during a chomp) may make use of it, but not this one. You might ask...why bother placing it in the first place? This is so that if the "chewing" animation needs to use this sprite, the engine will know where to place the Pikmin in the creature's mouth. As such, it's good practice to always place hitboxes in the right spot (more or less), even if they are disabled.</dd>
    </dl>

    <h3 id="anim">Making animations</h3>

    <p>Let's create the rest of the sprites for the walking animation. If you didn't notice, the "idle" frame is part of the walking animation. The idle pose is the Bulborb posing still in a neutral position, but to walk, a Bulborb needs to lift its right leg, return to the neutral position, lift the left, and return to neutral. For most enemies, the "idle" frame is actually used quite a lot. To create the sprites that will make up the rest of the walking animation's frames (walkl1, walkl2, walkr1, walkr2), check the Red Bulborb that comes with the engine. You can also copy and paste from the <code>Animations.txt</code> files. One thing to note is that "walkr1" is just "walkl1" except flipped vertically. You can obtain this effect by specifying a negative vertical scale (negative horizontal scale obviously means flipping horizontally) in the sprite transformation data.</p>
    
    <dl>
      <dt><b>In the animation panel, the large button at the top lets you choose/create an animation.</b></dt>
      <dd>This is the same case as with the sprite panel. Click on the button (which should be titled "(None)", and write <code>walk</code> as the name of our new animation, the walking animation.</dd>
      <dt><b>The frame list contains all sprites used in this animation. You can add one with the "+" button.</b></dt>
      <dd>The frame list is a list of the frames that this animation is composed of; each one of these makes use of a sprite we created earlier. Add the first frame by pressing the "+" button in the frame list section. In the "Sprite" option, choose our "idle" sprite, making this the first frame of our walking animation.</dd>
      <dt><b>Different frames of animation last for different durations before the next frame shows up.</b></dt>
      <dd>Next, we specify how long this frame exists for until it is replaced by the next one on the list. To make fluid-looking animations, you'll want values like 0.1 or 0.2.</dd>
      <dt><b>The "+" button that adds a new frame will conveniently copy data from the previous frame.</b></dt>
      <dd>Let's make the rest of the Bulborb's walking animation. Press "+" once again to add a new frame. Because it's using the same data as the first frame, the duration is already the same, so you don't need to worry. Just pick <code>walkr1</code> as the sprite. Afterwards, create frames with <code>walkr2</code>, then <code>walkr1</code> again, <code>idle</code>, <code>walkl1</code>, <code>walkl2</code>, and finally <code>walkl1</code>.</dd>
      <dt><b>When the last frame finishes, the animation returns to a previous frame (set in the panel) and loops from there.</b></dt>
      <dd>It would make sense for the animation to loop back to the first "idle" frame so it repeats the same "right foot, left foot" cycle. This is where the "Loop frame" box in the "Animation data" section is used. Luckily, it is already set at 1, which is the first frame, so you don't need to change it this time, but if you wanted the animation to repeat from a specific frame, this is where you'd write the frame's number.</dd>
      <dt><b>Notes:</b></dt>
      <dd><ul>
        <li>Feel free to play the animation with the "Play/Pause" button in the panel.</li>
        <li>You can also use the "Hitbox visibility" button on the toolbar to disable the hitboxes, which will give you a better view of the creature itself.</li>
        <li>The bottom of the canvas will show you a timeline with all frames. You can also click (or drag) inside of it to check out a specific point in the animation.</li>
      </ul></dd>
    </dl>

    <h3 id="pikmin-top">Pikmin tops</h3>
    
    <dl>
      <dt><b>The "Pikmin top" mode when editing sprites lets you set where the Pikmin's top goes.</b></dt>
      <dd>When editing sprites for a Pikmin, you will want to specify where the Pikmin's top (leaf, bud, or flower) is to be located on that frame. For that, click the "Pikmin top" button in the sprite panel, which is only available when editing animations for a Pikmin object.</dd>
      <dt><b>Use the panel or canvas handles to move, resize, and rotate the top.</b></dt>
      <dd>Like with other on-canvas handles, the center one lets you move the top around, the edge and corner ones let you resize it, and the circle handle lets you rotate it around. This top isn't included with the sprite, but its data will allow the engine to place the leaf, bud, or flower in the right spot during gameplay. Alternatively, you can use the widgets in the panel (drag or double-click them) to edit these properties.</dd>
      <dt><b>If the top isn't visible in a given sprite, uncheck the "Visible" checkbox.</b></dt>
      <dd>On some sprites, the top might not be visible whatsoever. For instance, when a Pikmin is thrown, on the frames where it is upside down, the top is under the Pikmin, so from a top-down view, it is impossible to see. For these cases, uncheck the "Visible" checkbox.</dd>
    </dl>

    <h2 id="necessary">Necessary animations</h2>

    <p>To create enemies, you can make whatever animations you wish, and you can call them whatever. As long as you use the correct names in the script, all is good. But for Pikmin, leaders, and most other objects, the engine is the one that decides what animations to switch to, and it expects to find them with specific names on the object's animation data. To know what animations your object needs, check the corresponding article in the <a href="mob_type.html#mob-categories">list of object categories</a>.</p>

    <h2 id="special">Special animations</h2>

    <p>The folder <code>Game_data/Animations</code> contains a list of custom animations that aren't necessarily bound to an object. These can include animations expected by the engine, like the status effects or liquids.</p>

    <h2 id="controls">Controls</h2>

    <p>Some widgets have keyboard shortcuts. If you have tooltips on (they can be enabled in the menu bar's "Help" menu), you can keep your cursor over them to learn what they are, if any. Besides that, here are some keyboard controls:</p>
    
    <table>
      <tr><td>Pan camera</td><td>Arrow keys, or right mouse button</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Zoom in and out</td><td>Plus/Minus, or mouse wheel</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Reset zoom; press again to reset camera position</td><td>Zero, or middle mouse button</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Change camera to fit whole scene snugly</td><td>Home</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Quit out of certain panels</td><td>Escape</td></tr>
    </table>

    <h2 id="tips">Tips</h2>
    
    <ul>
      <li>Remember to save periodically. Although rare, it is possible for the editor to crash, or for you to quit accidentally, causing you to lose unsaved progress.</li>
      <li>When making a spritesheet, try to add at least one row or column of empty pixels between each frame. Without this padding, some in-game sprites will have artifacts from a sprite right next to them, and when you click a section of the spritesheet to specify the bitmap, the editor could interpret a nearby pose as part of the same one.</li>
      <li>If your graphics are twice the resolution of your in-game size, you can enter the special tools from the main menu, and use the "Set all scales" tool. If they're twice as big, use the value "0.5" in this tool.</li>
      <li>If you have an enemy shaking animation, and only want a percentage of the Pikmin to be shaken of, you can lower the shake animation's "hit rate". For instance, if you use <code>70</code>, that means only 70% of the Pikmin that are latched on will get knocked off, on average. This can be used for other attacks too, not just shaking. This feature only affects Pikmin.</li>
      <li>When editing a sprite's hitboxes, if you have a large hitbox selected and you want to select one that's covered up by it, you can just click an area that is overlapped by both hitboxes, and the editor will toggle between the hitboxes in that spot.</li>
      <li>Use the options (in the menu bar) to customize the editor to your liking.</li>
      <li>Check the <a href="area.html#tips">area article's tips section</a> for a few tips on how Dear ImGui (the GUI framework) works.
