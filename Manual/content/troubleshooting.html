    <h1>Troubleshooting</h1>
    
    <p>If something is wrong, this page will try to fix your problem.</p>

    <h2 id="playing">Problems while playing</h2>
    
    <dl>
      <dt><b>Why did it crash?</b></dt>
      <dd>If you made some content for it and you suspect that that is the problem, please check the <code>User_data/Error_log.txt</code> file, if it exists. It should tell you what went wrong, like a missing comma, or a misspelled name. Fix the problems and try again.</dd>
      <dd>
        If you think the crash is due to a problem with the engine itself, then it could be one of the following:
        <ul>
          <li>You're not using the most recent version of the engine, which could have solved that problem. You should try upgrading if you're not up-to-date.</li>
          <li>The game is running from inside a zip file. Remember that when you download the engine's zip file, you need to unzip everything inside of it into a folder, before you're able to play.</li>
          <li>It's a problem that I need to fix. Please get in touch with me about it. I'll likely ask you to explain what you were doing when the crash happened, ask you to send me any errors in the <code>User_data/Error_log.txt</code> file, and ask you to send me the crash screenshots in the <code>User_data</code> folder. So you should try to get those ready.</li>
        </ul>
      </dd>
      
      <dt><b>Why can't I see the game window?</b></dt>
      <dd>Because windows sometimes break under Windows.</dd>
      <dd>Open <code>User_data/Options.txt</code>, go to the line with <code>window_pos_hack=false</code>, and change it to <code>window_pos_hack=true</code>.</dd>
      
      <dt><b>Why is it running slowly?</b></dt>
      <dd>Well, it IS a complex engine running the flexible logic behind several dozens of entities, so it's only natural.</dd>
      <dd>You can check the <code>User_data/Options.txt</code> file and use the Pikmin Fanon page for settings that you can change in order to sacrifice appearance for performance.</dd>
      <dd>If you suspect some of the content you've made is having an impact on performance, try the <a href="maker_toolkit.html#perf-mon">performance monitor</a>.</dd>
      
      <dt><b>Why are some parts of the logic and physics so broken?</b></dt>
      <dd>Because their code is still under construction, most likely.</dd>
      
      <dt><b>Why are some textures black, but not HUD elements?</b></dt>
      <dd>Are you running it under Wine? If so, update Wine. That fixed the problem for a friend that had it. If not, contact me, and I'll try to see what's up.</dd>
      
      <dt><b>Why does the engine think I'm touching the analog stick when I'm not?</b></dt>
      <dd>You can open <code>User_data/Options.txt</code> and set <code>joystick_min_deadzone</code> to a higher value. This way, a loose analog stick won't be accounted for if it is simply wiggling a bit.</dd>
    </dl>
    
    <h2 id="making">Problems while making</h2>
    
    <dl>
      <dt><b>Why do I see everything in a single line when I open a <a href="data_file.html">data file</a> with Notepad?</b></dt>
      <dd>Don't use Notepad. It has a hard time doing LF-only line breaks, which most of the engine's files use.</dd>
      <dd>Install Notepad++ and start using that instead, since it's better in every way.</dd>

      <dt><b>Why are my graphics showing up as black and violet patterns?</b></dt>
      <dd>
        That's what the engine shows when it can't open a texture. Make sure you're following these points:
        <ul>
          <li>File names are case sensitive. Lowercase and uppercase matter.</li>
          <li>You need to include the extension. This is the <code>.jpg</code> or <code>.png</code> part of the file name.</li>
          <li>The engine only finds the image in one folder. General images go in <code>Game_data/Graphics</code>, and textures go in <code>Game_data/Graphics/Textures</code>.</li>
        </ul>
      </dd>

      <dt><b>One of my textures is cutting off to black or to garbage, in a repeating pattern.</b></dt>
      <dd>Your texture's resolution does not use power-of-two numbers. It doesn't happen on all machines, but that's the solution, I guess...</dd>

      <dt><b>I'm having a hard time understanding X.</b></dt>
      <dd>Please let me know. I try to make the interface, mechanics, and tutorials be as easy to understand as possible.</dd>
      <dd>If you contact me, I can help you with your problem, as well as change things to make them easier to understand in the future.</dd>
    </dl>

    <h2 id="known_issues">Known issues</h2>

    <p>This is a list of glitches with the engine that are known to exist, but can't be solved right now, either because they are too difficult to fix, or because they are not a priority. When possible, a solution or workaround is presented too.</p>

    <dl>
      <dt><b>In the area editor, when you have a square sector with another square sector inside, if you try to move an edge from the internal sector into the equivalent external sector's edge, but the external sector's edge has some moot vertexes (vertexes where both edges at 180 degrees), the area's geometry will break.</b></dt>
      <dd>If this happens to you, just undo and make sure there are no moot vertexes in the destination edge.</dd>

      <dt><b>In the area editor, if a vertex has two edges at opposite angles, but said angles are not axis-aligned, then you start drawing a new sector by starting on one edge, and clicking the other, then that will break the geometry.</b></dt>
      <dd>Please do not do that.</dd>

      <dt><b>Objects blindly pick the start and end path stops in a path by just checking which are closest to the start and end coordinates.</b></dt>
      <dd>I could make the objects also check if they're not entering a path graph with no return, or a path stop that's in a hazard they are vulnerable to, or a path stop that's meant for airborne travel only (which isn't even a thing, since only path links determine that), or so on. But that would be very difficult, and would lead to bizarre unintuitive behaviors, not to mention performance issues.</dd>
      
      <dt><b>Some wall shadows that fade away into a small size look really thin.</b></dt>
      <dd>Technically the engine is drawing the shapes of the shadows correctly, from a thick size to a small size, but the color interpolation done by the graphics backend sometimes does a bad job when the final two points of the shadow are so thin. There is not much that can be done to fix this.</dd>
