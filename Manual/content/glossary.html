    <p>A glossary of terms used in <i>Pikifen</i>, both for casual play, and for making content. This glossary will not include terms popular in the <i>Pikmin</i> franchise, since you can find more about those on <a href="https://www.pikminwiki.com">Pikipedia</a>, and will also not focus on terms used in the engine's code, even though most of them match what you'd read outside of the code.</p>

      <dt>Action</dt>
      <dd>Something that an object can do in its <a href="#S">script</a>. This includes walking to a certain point, losing <a href="#H">health</a>, changing its <a href="#A">animation</a>, etc.</dd>

    <dl>
      <dt>Animation</dt>
      <dd>A series of <a href="#F">frames</a> that change the way an object looks. When put together nicely, these make it look like the object is walking, growling, chomping, etc. Animations are independent of what the object is actually doing. For instance, it can be walking, but it could be frozen in appearance, which would make it appear to slide. That said, accurate animations are necessary for gameplay reasons, like <a href="#H">hitboxes</a>.</dd>

    </dl>
    <dl>
      <dt>Enemy</dt>
      <dd>Enemy is a general term for the creatures that attack or are attacked by Pikmin. Although it makes little sense, one could make a fire geyser "enemy", and it would be technically valid.</dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
      <dt>Error</dt>
      <dd>If something goes wrong when loading or during gameplay, the engine will write an error on the error log file. Not all errors will result in a crash, but ideally, one should aim to resolve all of them.</dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
      <dt>Event</dt>
      <dd>When something happens to an object, like when it gets hurt, or it reaches its destination, an event is thrown. In the <a href="#S">script</a>, you can specify what <a href="#A">actions</a> to perform whenever a certain event is triggered.

    <dl>
      <dt>Glow</dt>
      <dd>A way to brighten up an object. Due to Allegro limitations, it's not a real glow in the current versions of the engine because: 1. the brightness is limited to the bitmap's original pixels &#8211; darker bitmaps have a harder time becoming brighter; 2. the glow doesn't bleed and fade out, but is limited to the exact shape of the original bitmap.</dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
      <dt>Group</dt>
      <dd>The group of objects that follow another object. Typically, the group of Pikmin+leaders following a leader.</dd>

    </dl>
    <dl>
      <dt>Hazard</dt>
      <dd>Like in the canon games, a hazard refers to the concept of danger, not to a physical object. Electricity (danger of being shocked), fire (danger of burning up), etc. are all hazards, but electrical wires, fire geysers, and so on are just obstacles whose attacks involve hazards.</dd>
      <dd>Further reading: <a href="hazard.html">Making hazards</a>.</dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
      <dt>Health</dt>
      <dd>Every <a href="#O">object</a> in the engine has an amount of health, whether that is used for anything or not. Objects can be attacked in a few ways, and doing so depletes health. When the health reaches zero, the object is considered dead, and its behavior when that happens depends on the type of object.</dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
      <dt>Height effect</dt>
      <dd>To help portray depths, objects that are in mid-air may appear larger than they would appear on land. Or if they are falling into a pit, they may appear smaller and smaller. This is called the "height effect".</dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
      <dt>Hitbox</dt>
      <dd>A hitbox is a part of a <a href="#S">sprite</a> that represents where a <a href="#B">body part</a> is at that moment. It also contains information about how that body part relates to combat at that moment &#8211; the body part could be vulnerable to enemy attacks, it could be causing damage of its own, etc.</dd>

    <dl>
      <dt>HUD</dt>
      <dd>Refers to the on-screen elements visible to the player to help them understand what is going on during gameplay. The Pikmin counter, health meters, sun meter, etc. are all HUD elements.</dd>

      <dt>Ingredient</dt>
      <dd>An ingredient for concocting a spray. In the canon games, these are berries. After a certain number of ingredients of a certain type are collected, the player gains one more dosage of a certain spray.</dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
      <dt>Itch</dt>
      <dd>When an object has been taking damage for a while, an "itch" <a href="#E">event</a> will be triggered. This periodic event allows an enemy to shake Pikmin off when it is under attack. In order for the enemy to not shake several times in a row, an "itch" event will only be triggered if enough time has passed since the last one, and if enough damage has been done since the last one.</dd>

      <dt>Liquid</dt>
      <dd>Water, mud, lava, etc. are all liquids. If a <a href="#S">sector</a> has an associated liquid, it will change the sector's appearance to have a water surface <a href="#T">texture</a>, among other things. If a liquid has an associated <a href="#H">hazard</a>, <a href="#O">objects</a> vulnerable to that hazard can get affected when they walk on the sector.</dd>

    <dl>
      <dt>Opponent</dt>
      <dd>In the engine, "opponent" refers to any <a href="#O">object</a> that the current object wants to hunt down. For instance, Pikmin and enemies are opponents of each other, but gates and enemies are not opponents. Two objects that are normally opponents but belong to the same <a href="#T">team</a>, will no longer be opponents.</dd>

      <dt>Particle</dt>
      <dd>A particle is a small, simple thing that shows up on the game world, disappears with time, and follows a very simple behavior. They are used for graphical effects and ambiance. For instance, because each particle is its own thing, you can have a Wollywog's landing cause several smoke particles to appear, each moving away from the creature, to simulate dust picking up after a thud.</dd>

      <dt>Ramp</dt>
      <dd>Although <a href="#S">sectors</a> in the engine have a fixed height, and hence, cannot ramp smoothly from one height to another, the engine doesn't have real ramps. However, a convincing alternative is to just use stairs. Any wall that is 50 units or less in height can make an <a href="#O">object</a> walk up or down the sectors smoothly as they move forward and back.</dd>
      <dd>Further reading: <a href="area.html">Making areas</a>.</dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
      <dt>Relative angle</dt>
      <dd>Unlike an <a href="#A">absolute angle</a>, a relative angle of 0 means the same angle that the object is facing, a relative angle of 10 means the same angle as the object but 10 degrees anti-clockwise, etc.</dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
      <dt>Relative coordinates</dt>
      <dd>Unlike <a href="#A">absolute coordinates</a>, relative coordinates like for example "50,100" mean that this is at the object's position, plus 50 to the right, and 100 down. This is assuming the object is facing the right/east. If it isn't, the coordinates rotate around the object, such that a positive X is always in front of the object. So for coordinates "50,100", this would mean 50 units in front of the object, and 100 units to its right-hand side.</dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
      <dt>Rotation</dt>
      <dd>One of the primary <a href="#T">transformations</a>. When a shape, image, etc. is spun clockwise or counter-clockwise, that is called a rotation.</dd>

      <dt>Script</dt>
      <dd>An <a href="#O">object</a>'s script controls what the object should do when certain scenarios occur. Every object is in a <a href="#S">state</a> at any given time, and depending on the <a href="#E">events</a> it receives while in a specific state, it can do a different set of <a href="#A">actions</a>.</dd>

      <dd>As a verb, it means "to make appear". When an object is created and placed into the game world, it is said that it has "spawned". As a noun, it refers to any object created by the current object.</dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
      <dt>Spike</dt>
      <dd>Spike damage is a special type of damage that only happens in retaliation. When an <a href="#O">object</a> is hurt, if it has spike damage configured, it will automatically hurt its attacker as well. Another type of spike damage happens when a Pikmin is swallowed; this allows White Pikmin to cause some damage to their predators.</dd>

      <dd>When making <a href="#A">animations</a>, a sprite is a <a href="#B">bitmap</a> that represents how the animation looks at a specific point in time. Sprites are used in <a href="#F">frames</a>, and one sprite can be used in more than one frame. For instance, an image of an enemy with its leg up could represent part of its walking animation, growling animation, dying animation, etc.</dd>

      <dt>State</dt>
      <dd>Every <a href="#O">object</a> with a <a href="#S">script</a> is in a specific state at any given time. When an <a href="#E">event</a> is received, the state the object is on will influence the response. For instance, when a Pikmin is near a Red Bulborb, if the Bulborb is in the "sleeping" state, it should wake up, but if it is in the "chasing" state, it should lunge in for a bite.</dd>

      <dt>Status</dt>
      <dd>An <a href="#O">object</a> can be under the influence of any number of statuses. These affect the object's stats. For instance, if a Pikmin is under the "burning" status effect, it loses health at a steady pace. If it is under the "spicy" status effect, it gains a boost in speed until the status wears off.</dd>

    <dl>
      <dt>Territory</dt>
      <dd>An imaginary circle around an object's <a href="#H">home</a>. If the object goes past this circle, the "far from home" <a href="#E">event</a> is triggered, which is normally used to make enemies turn around and go back to a more comfortable place instead of wandering off too far.</dd>

      <dt>Texture</dt>

      <dt>Transformation</dt>
      <dd>Certain shapes, images, or other such things in the engine can be transformed using primary <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_transformation">geometric transformations</a>. This is what allows you to resize, flip, rotate, or shift an enemy's image, for instance. The following primary transformations exist: <a href="#T">translation</a>, <a href="#S">scale</a>, and <a href="#R">rotation</a>.</dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
      <dt>Translation</dt>

      <dd>Internally, a <a href="#S">sector</a> is made up of triangles, since those are needed for rendering and physics. They are generated automatically, and are not controllable by the user. That said, the disposition of the triangles can help explain the twisted look of some <a href="#F">fade sectors</a>, as well as other minor quirks.</dd>
