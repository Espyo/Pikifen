    <p>This page will describe several miscellaneous features in <i>Pikifen</i> that don't quite fit in other pages.</p>

    <h2 id="mob-links">Object links</h2>
    
    <p>You can make one object in the area have a link towards another object. This allows one object to send messages to its links, with the appropriate <a href="script.html">script actions</a>. It also makes it possible for the engine to know how certain special objects should function, when they need to know data about a second object. Connections are one-way, so if you want object A to send messages to object B and vice-versa, you will need to create a link from B to A as well.</p>

    <p>To link an object to another, you can either link them in the <a href="area.html#linked-mobs">area editor</a>, link them via the <code>link_with_focused_mob</code> <a href="events_and_actions.html">object script action</a>, or do the linking when an object is <a href="mob_type.html#spawning">spawning another</a>. In the latter case, you can specify if you want the link to be from the spawner object to the spawned object, the opposite, or both.

    <h2 id="markup">Markup</h2>

    <p>When writing some text to show in-game, some features of the engine allow you to write special tags, which will be replaced with something else in-game, like a line break or the icon of a player input. These tags always start with a backslash (<code>\</code>), so if you want the engine to show an actual backslash in-game as opposed to trying to understand some tag, write <code>\\</code> instead. Unless otherwise specificed, features that support markup will also automatically break into the next line when the current line is too long. The following features support markup:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>An <a href="area.html">area's</a> description, to be shown on the area selection menu.</li>
      <li>Mid-game message boxes, like the ones shown by the <code>show_message_from_var</code> <a href="events_and_actions.html">object script action</a> (commonly used by the likes of <a href="mob_interactable.html">signs</a>).</li>
      <li>The pause menu's <a href="gui.html#pause-menu-help">help tidbits</a>.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The following tags exist:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><code>\\</code>: Inserts an actual backslash (<code>\</code>).</li>
      <li><code>\n</code>: Inserts a line break, meaning the text will end the current line and go to the next.</li>
      <li><code>\k</code>: Inserts an input's icon for a given action. This will automatically show the key, button, etc. that the player has mapped to the action you specify, and can even show "(NONE)" if none is bound. The name of the action needs to be placed between two of these tags, and you can use spaces between them to make it easier to read. So for instance, typing <code>\k throw \k</code> will show the input the player has currently assigned for throwing, so likely the icon for a left mouse button. The names of each action are pretty obvious, like <code>throw</code>, <code>move_up</code>, or <code>lie_down</code>, but you can open the <a href="options.html">options file</a> and check the properties that save the player's controls for a full list.</li>
    </ul>
