    <p>The following is a general changelog for <i>Pikifen</i>. This changelog will only list the most notable differences between each version of the engine; for a more detailed list of changes throughout the development period, check the <a href="https://github.com/Espyo/Pikifen/commits/master">commit log on GitHub</a>.</p>

    <p>Some versions may be unable to read content created in older versions. If you want to keep your content from one version to the next, read the "Content making changes" list in that update's section.</p>

    <p>Versions are numbered after the format <code>major.minor.revision</code>. The major number increases when the project is radically different from the major version before it. The minor number increases every time there are a bunch of changes. The revision number increases when there are bug fixes on the revision before it, and does not break compatibility unless that's necessary to fix something.</p>

    <p><i>Under development</i></p>

    <p><b>Gameplay changes</b></p>

    <ul>
      <li><span class="cl-a">Added</span> <a href="mob_interactable.html">levers</a>. Interact with a leader or throw a Pikmin to power or stop powering devices.</li>
      <li><span class="cl-a">Added</span> <a href="mob_interactable.html">buttons</a>. Interact with a leader or throw a Pikmin to power devices for a split-second.</li>
      <li><span class="cl-a">Added</span> <a href="mob_custom.html">logic gates</a>. These allow for complex mechanisms, like a gate that only opens if two different power sources are on.</li>
      <li><span class="cl-a">Added</span> Audio volume options.</li>
      <li><span class="cl-a">Added</span> headers to each menu.</li>
      <li><span class="cl-a">Added</span> the ability to close messages with the "pause" button.</li>
      <li><span class="cl-c">Changed</span> how some objects push against each other. Now, leaders and Pikmin can squeeze through them to get unstuck. This does not apply to more "solid" objects like gates.</li>
      <li><span class="cl-c">Changed</span> the range for an idle Pikmin to be considered "bumped" by the active leader, so they can be called from farther away.</li>
      <li><span class="cl-c">Changed</span> the way the Yellow Wollywog works to make the fight easier and a bit more dynamic.</li>
      <li><span class="cl-c">Changed</span> the options menu to be split into pages.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><b>Content making changes</b></p>

    <ul>
      <li><span class="cl-a">Added</span> the <code>pushes_softly</code> property to <a href="mob_type.html">mob types</a>.</li>
      <li><span class="cl-c">Added</span> the <code>blackout_radius</code> <a href="mob_type.html">mob type</a> property. (Thanks Helodity)</li>
      <li><span class="cl-a">Added</span> the <code>area_editor_recommend_links_from</code> and <code>area_editor_recommend_links_to</code> properties to <a href="mob_type.html">mob types</a>.</li>
      <li><span class="cl-a">Added</span> support for the thus far-unused <code>maturity_power_mult</code> property of the <a href="misc_config.html">game configuration</a>.</li>
      <li><span class="cl-a">Added</span> the <code>idle_bump_range</code> property to the <a href="misc_config.html">game configuration</a>.</li>
      <li><span class="cl-c">Added</span> the ability for a sector to reuse the same vertex. Before, it just considered the sector broken.</li>
      <li><span class="cl-c">Added</span> the ability to create sub-sectors. This happens if one sector's polygon ends up getting split into two. While not recommended, it stops the maker from receiving warnings and from the sector to be considered broken.</li>
      <li><span class="cl-c">Added</span> the ability to keep drawing a new sector, for when you try to split a sector but the engine considers that split useless.</li>
      <li><span class="cl-c">Added</span> a redo feature to the area editor.</li>
      <li><span class="cl-a">Added</span> three new player actions to the controls: <code>custom_a</code>, <code>custom_b</code>, and <code>custom_c</code>. These do nothing on their own, but can be detected through <a href="script.html">leader scripts</a>. (Thanks WanderingLetterS)</li>
      <li><span class="cl-a">Added</span> the <code>on_input_received</code> <a href="events_and_actions.html">object script event</a>.</li>
      <li><span class="cl-c">Added</span> the <code>on_ready</code> <a href="script.html">mob event</a>.</li>
      <li><span class="cl-a">Added</span> the <code>get_area_info</code>, <code>get_event_info</code>, and <code>get_mob_info</code> <a href="script.html">mob actions</a>. All data obtained from <code>get_info</code> are now obtained by the corresponding actions.  (Thanks Helodity)</li>
      <li><span class="cl-r">Removed</span> the <code>get_info</code> <a href="script.html">mob action</a>, since it was replaced by the previous three actions. (Thanks Helodity)</li>
      <li><span class="cl-r">Removed</span> the <code>get_focus_info</code> <a href="script.html">mob action</a>, since it was replaced by <code>get_mob_info</code> with the <code>focus</code> target. (Thanks Helodity)</li>

      <li><span class="cl-c">Added</span> the system sound effects to the <a href="misc_config.html#system-asset">system asset file names list</a>.</li>
      <li><span class="cl-c">Added</span> the ability for objects to play sounds via <a href="animation.html">animations</a> or <a href="script.html">scripting</a>.</li>
      <li><span class="cl-c">Added</span> the ability for different Pikmin types to play different sounds.</li>
      <li>
        Pathing changes:
        <ul>
          <li><span class="cl-c">Added</span> the "ledge" link type. Normal mobs can go from a higher path stop to a lower one but not the other way around, unless they are airborne.</li>
          <li><span class="cl-c">Added</span> the "script use only", "light load only", and "airborne only" settings to stops. These replace the equivalent link types. Also, added labels to stops, which replace labels in links.</li>
          <li><span class="cl-r">Removed</span> all link types except for the newly-added "ledge" type, since they were replaced by the equivalent stop settings. Also, removed link labels, since they too were replaced with a stop property.</li>
          <li><span class="cl-c">Added</span> a radius property to path stops.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li><span class="cl-c">Changed</span> the list of existing <a href="misc_config.html#system-asset">system asset file names</a> to be inside of a <code>graphics</code> block.</li>

      <li><span class="cl-c">Changed</span> the way leader type and Pikmin type sounds are configured. Instead of properties starting with <code>sfx_</code>, or just hardcoded files starting with <code>Pikmin_</code>, they are now standard object type sounds.</li>

    <p><i>July 14th, 2023 &ndash; the "new areas" update</i></p>

    <p><b>Gameplay changes</b></p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        New areas:
        <ul>
          <li><span class="cl-a">Added</span> Tutorial Meadow. If you never played an area before, you will be prompted to start here.</li>
          <li><span class="cl-a">Added</span> Cryptic Atrium. A medium-short puzzle stage with pressure plates and automatic gates.</li>
          <li><span class="cl-a">Added</span> Playful Yard. A reincarnation of the old "Play" area, with a more playful motif, better design, and as a proper mission.</li>
          <li><span class="cl-a">Added</span> Crash Landing. A difficult quick mission to get all treasures before time runs out. (Thanks Helodity)</li>
          <li><span class="cl-a">Added</span> DEV Lab. It showcases pretty much everything <i>Pikifen</i> has to offer.</li>
          <li><span class="cl-r">Removed</span> Play in favor of Playful Yard.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        New objects:
        <ul>
          <li><span class="cl-a">Added</span> <a href="mob_interactable.html">orb signs</a>, which work like signs but are generic orbs instead of wooden planks.</li>
          <li><span class="cl-a">Added</span> <a href="mob_bouncer.html">geysers</a>, a type of bouncer that only leaders can use.</li>
          <li><span class="cl-a">Added</span> <a href="mob_resource.html">carriable rocks</a>, which can be carried around and dropped to weigh on something.</li>
          <li><span class="cl-a">Added</span> <a href="mob_scale.html">pressure plates</a>, which trigger some other object to do something whenever they have enough weight on them.</li>
          <li><span class="cl-a">Added</span> <a href="mob_custom.html">automatic gates</a>, which lift in the air whenever they are powered by things like a pressure plate.</li>
          <li><span class="cl-a">Added</span> <a href="mob_custom.html">carry targets</a>, which allows other things to be carried to it for no effect.</li>
          <li><span class="cl-a">Added</span> some <a href="mob_treasure.html">treasures</a>: a fidget spinner, a yo-yo, and a jigsaw puzzle piece.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Misc:
        <ul>
          <li><span class="cl-a">Added</span> images to the help page of the pause menu. (Thanks erdinvark)</li>
          <li><span class="cl-a">Added</span> a random area button to the area selection menu.</li>
          <li><span class="cl-a">Added</span> mission statistics for the total of clears, total of platinum medals, and total combined sum of score points.</li>
          <li><span class="cl-c">Changed</span> the way paper bags work to make it so leaders can't be thrown on top, and so that Pikmin can't accidentally be thrown over them to the other side.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p><b>Content making changes</b></p>

    <ul>
      <li>Editor improvements:
        <ul>
          <li><span class="cl-a">Added</span> a bunch of menu bar items across all editors.</li>
          <li><span class="cl-a">Added</span> a toolbar button to the area editor to toggle preview mode. Advanced interface mode only.</li>
          <li><span class="cl-a">Added</span> the ability to lock to an axis while dragging, if Ctrl is held.</li>
          <li><span class="cl-a">Added</span> the ability to add to the selection when dragging a selection box, if Ctrl is held.</li>
          <li><span class="cl-a">Added</span> the ability to copy a sector, edge, object, or path link's properties, so they can then be pasted elsewhere.</li>

          <li><span class="cl-c">Changed</span> the unsaved changes warning to be a dialog like in most programs. The idea of the old pop-up was to require fewer clicks and mouse movement when you were sure you wanted to not save, but some actions are hidden behind menus which forces you to go there twice. The dialog approach comes with many quality-of-life tweaks that make it an overall better feature.</li>
          <li><span class="cl-c">Changed</span> the way copying textures from a different sector works. Instead of selecting the source, then hovering the mouse over the destination and pressing T, you now copy the source sector's properties, then paste just the texture on the selected sectors.</li>
          <li><span class="cl-c">Changed</span> what happens when the user is drawing a new sector and clicks on an edge or vertex. Instead of throwing an error, the editor now changes the drawing to a sector split drawing, and lets the user continue drawing from the opposite end.</li>
          <li><span class="cl-c">Changed</span> the area editor's saving procedure to no longer need to boot the user back to the main panel.</li>
        </ul>

          <li><span class="cl-a">Added</span> the <code>hud</code> <a href="maker_toolkit.html">maker tool</a>.</li>
          <li><span class="cl-a">Added</span> the <code>path_info</code> <a href="maker_toolkit.html">maker tool</a>.</li>
          <li><span class="cl-a">Added</span> the <code>custom_carry_spots</code> property to <a href="mob_type.html">mob types</a>.</li>
          <li><span class="cl-a">Added</span> the <code>power_goal</code> script variable to <a href="mob_group_task.html">group tasks</a>.</li>
          <li><span class="cl-a">Added</span> the <code>goal_number</code> script variable to <a href="mob_scale.html">scales</a>.</li>
          <li><span class="cl-a">Added</span> the <code>stay</code> value to a <a href="mob_resource.html">resource type's</a> delivery results.</li>
          <li><span class="cl-a">Added</span> the <code>linked_mob_matching_type</code> value to a <a href="mob_resource.html">resource type's</a> carrying destinations.</li>
          <li><span class="cl-a">Added</span> the <code>area_image_padding</code> property to the <a href="maker_toolkit.html">maker tools</a>.</li>
          <li><span class="cl-a">Added</span> the ability for dead enemies to drop objects via a "stored inside" feature in the area editor. This allows the engine to detect things like treasures inside enemies for the purposes of missions.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p><b>Breaking changes</b></p>

    <ul>
      <li><span class="cl-r">Removed</span> the ability for dead enemies to drop objects via the <code>spoils</code> and <code>random_pellet_spoils</code> script variables, in favor of the "stored inside" area editor feature. Areas with such objects need to be adjusted.</li>
      <li><span class="cl-c">Changed</span> the following obstacles to have a consistent 192px size: electrical wire (also now doesn't push), paper bag (also now blocks paths), cardboard box, wood bridge.</li>
      <li><span class="cl-c">Changed</span> the spritesheet for player input icons (formerly control icons). All properties and files changed from <code>control_icon</code> to <code>player_input_icon</code>.</li>
      <li><span class="cl-c">Changed</span> the <code>show_hud_controls</code> option to <code>show_hud_input_icons</code>.</li>
      <li><span class="cl-c">Changed</span> the gameplay GUI item names that had <code>button</code> in them to instead have <code>input</code>.</li>
      <li><span class="cl-c">Changed</span> the default value of an <a href="mob_type.html">object type</a>'s <code>can_walk_on_others</code> properties to false.</li>
      <li><span class="cl-c">Changed</span> the name of some texture files: <code>Bark</code> &rarr; <code>Wood_bark</code>. <code>Bridge</code> &rarr; <code>Wood_bridge</code>. <code>Bridge_rail</code> &rarr; <code>Wood_bridge_rail</code>. <code>Metal</code> &rarr; <code>Metal_rusted</code>. <code>Stump</code> &rarr; <code>Wood_stump</code>.</li>

    <ul>
      <li>Added a help page to the pause menu, with gameplay information, tips, controls, Pikmin type explanations, and more.</li>
      <li>White Pikmin poison now applies a status effect that drains health over time. Enemies still end up losing the same amount of health in the end.</li>
      <li>Pikmin are now better at detecting gates and other rectangular objects.</li>
      <li>Pikmin can now circle around enemies when in combat.</li>
      <li>Bridges now grow in chunks, and the point Pikmin deliver fragments to, or the position of the pile of sticks, now moves along with the bridge.</li>
      <li>
        Misc. graphical enhancements:
        <ul>
          <li>All gates have received graphical improvements.</li>
          <li>Decorative objects no longer cast light in blackout weather.</li>
          <li>When Pikmin deliver an object to an Onion, ship, etc., the sucking animation is now more dynamic. Also, added a tossing animation for delivering bridge fragments to bridges.</li>
          <li>Improved the look of the ship's beam and the leader's whistle. The <code>pretty_whistle</code> option has been removed. (Thanks Helodity)</li>
          <li>HUD elements now animate when things change, and slide off-frame when menus are entered in-game. (Thanks Helodity)</li>
          <li>In-game message boxes are now much more animated.</li>
          <li>Health wheels and fraction numbers now appear and disappear smoothly, and are more animated in general.</li>
          <li>Enemies now squash and stretch when damaged.</li>
          <li>Objects being carried now sway.</li>
          <li>Icons for controls have been improved.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Fixed leaders being able to grab group members from the other side of walls or objects with collision, like gates.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p><b>Content making changes</b></p>

    <ul>
      <li><a href="mob_bridge.html">Bridges</a> are now made up of objects. This should make the process of placing bridges in an area much simpler, since there's no need to fiddle around with sectors. Areas with bridges need to be updated to use this new bridge format.</li>
      <li><a href="status.html">Status effects</a> now have a <code>health_change</code> property, which controls how much health the object loses per second in an absolute value, instead of it being a ratio of total health.</li>
      <li><a href="misc_config.html#spike-damage">Spike damage types</a> now have a <code>status_to_apply</code> property, which allows the damaged object to receive a status effect.</li>
      <li><a href="mob_type.html">Object types</a> now have a <code>status_vulnerabilities</code> block, which works like the other vulnerability blocks, but controls damage taken from status effects.</li>
      <li><a href="mob_type.html">Object types</a> now have a <code>terrain_radius</code> property, which controls their collision against walls.</li>
      <li><a href="mob_type.html">Object types</a> now have a <code>description</code> property, which can be used to briefly describe it. This 
        appears in the area editor, and Pikmin types make use of this for the help page of the in-game pause menu.</li>
      <li>The tooltip of an <a href="mob_type.html">object type</a>'s area editor property now word-wraps automatically. If you relied on line breaks (<code>\n</code>) to do this before, you may want to adjust it.</li>
      <li>The <code>set_animation</code> <a href="events_and_actions.html">script action</a> now accepts the options <code>random_time</code> and <code>random_time_on_spawn</code>, to let the animation start on a random time, or start on a random time but only if the mob just spawned.</li>
      <li>Added the <code>on_receive_delivery</code> <a href="events_and_actions.html">object script event</a>.</li>
      <li>Added the <code>health_ratio</code> option to the <code>get_info</code> <a href="events_and_actions.html">object script action</a>.</li>
      <li>Added the <code>health</code> <a href="script.html">script variable</a>.</li>
      <li>Added the <code>max_health</code> <a href="script.html">script variable</a>.</li>
      <li>Added the <code>bright_circle</code> and <code>bright_ring</code> <a href="misc_config.html">system assets</a>.</li>
      <li>The area editor now also shows the terrain radius of selected objects (if the "Show territory/terrain radius" option is on).</li>
      <li><a href="converter_type.html">Converters</a> now use an animation called <code>bumped</code> instead of <code>bumping</code>, for consistency's sake.</li>
      <li><a href="misc_config.html">System assets</a> no longer have icons for mouse-related controls, but instead have one spreadsheet for many special control icons.</li>
      <li>The <a href="gui.html">gameplay HUD</a> received all sorts of new items, and some have been renamed to be more consistent.</li>
      <li><a href="area.html">Areas</a> and <a href="animation.html">animations</a> now save the engine version they were edited in. This will likely be used in the future to allow the engine to automatically port older content to newer versions.</li>
