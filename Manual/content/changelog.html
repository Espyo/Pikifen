    <p>The following is a general changelog for <i>Pikifen</i>. This changelog will only list the most notable differences between each version of the engine; for a more detailed list of changes throughout the development period, check the <a href="https://github.com/Espyo/Pikifen/commits/master">commit log on GitHub</a>.</p>

    <p>Some versions may be unable to read content created in older versions. If you want to keep your content from one version to the next, read the "Content making changes" list in that update's section.</p>

    <p>Versions are numbered after the format <code>major.minor.revision</code>. The major number increases when the project is radically different from the major version before it. The minor number increases every time there are a bunch of changes. The revision number increases when there are bug fixes on the revision before it, and does not break compatibility unless that's necessary to fix something.</p>

        Audio improvements:
        <ul>

        Pathing changes:
        <ul>
          <li><span class="cl-a">Added</span> the "ledge" link type. Normal mobs can go from a higher path stop to a lower one but not the other way around, unless they are airborne.</li>
          <li><span class="cl-a">Added</span> the "script use only", "light load only", and "airborne only" settings to stops. These replace the equivalent link types. Also, added labels to stops, which replace labels in links.</li>

        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>

          <li><span class="cl-a">Added</span> three new player actions to the controls: <code>custom_a</code>, <code>custom_b</code>, and <code>custom_c</code>. These do nothing on their own, but can be detected through <a href="script.html">leader scripts</a>. (Thanks WanderingLetterS)</li>
          <li><span class="cl-a">Added</span> the <code>is_boss</code> property to <a href="mob_enemy.html">enemy types</a>.</li>

    <p><b>Gameplay changes</b></p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        New areas:
        <ul>
          <li><span class="cl-a">Added</span> Tutorial Meadow. If you never played an area before, you will be prompted to start here.</li>
          <li><span class="cl-a">Added</span> Cryptic Atrium. A medium-short puzzle stage with pressure plates and automatic gates.</li>
          <li><span class="cl-a">Added</span> Playful Yard. A reincarnation of the old "Play" area, with a more playful motif, better design, and as a proper mission.</li>
          <li><span class="cl-a">Added</span> Crash Landing. A difficult quick mission to get all treasures before time runs out. (Thanks Helodity)</li>
          <li><span class="cl-a">Added</span> DEV Lab. It showcases pretty much everything <i>Pikifen</i> has to offer.</li>

        </ul>
      </li>

          <li><span class="cl-a">Added</span> <a href="mob_interactable.html">orb signs</a>, which work like signs but are generic orbs instead of wooden planks.</li>
          <li><span class="cl-a">Added</span> <a href="mob_bouncer.html">geysers</a>, a type of bouncer that only leaders can use.</li>
          <li><span class="cl-a">Added</span> <a href="mob_resource.html">carriable rocks</a>, which can be carried around and dropped to weigh on something.</li>
          <li><span class="cl-a">Added</span> <a href="mob_scale.html">pressure plates</a>, which trigger some other object to do something whenever they have enough weight on them.</li>
          <li><span class="cl-a">Added</span> <a href="mob_custom.html">automatic gates</a>, which lift in the air whenever they are powered by things like a pressure plate.</li>
          <li><span class="cl-a">Added</span> <a href="mob_custom.html">carry targets</a>, which allows other things to be carried to it for no effect.</li>
          <li><span class="cl-a">Added</span> some <a href="mob_treasure.html">treasures</a>: a fidget spinner, a yo-yo, and a jigsaw puzzle piece.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Misc:
        <ul>
          <li><span class="cl-a">Added</span> images to the help page of the pause menu. (Thanks erdinvark)</li>
          <li><span class="cl-a">Added</span> a random area button to the area selection menu.</li>
          <li><span class="cl-a">Added</span> mission statistics for the total of clears, total of platinum medals, and total combined sum of score points.</li>
          <li><span class="cl-c">Changed</span> the way paper bags work to make it so leaders can't be thrown on top, and so that Pikmin can't accidentally be thrown over them to the other side.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p><b>Content making changes</b></p>

    <ul>
      <li>Editor improvements:
        <ul>
          <li><span class="cl-a">Added</span> a bunch of menu bar items across all editors.</li>
          <li><span class="cl-a">Added</span> a toolbar button to the area editor to toggle preview mode. Advanced interface mode only.</li>
          <li><span class="cl-a">Added</span> the ability to lock to an axis while dragging, if Ctrl is held.</li>
          <li><span class="cl-a">Added</span> the ability to add to the selection when dragging a selection box, if Ctrl is held.</li>
          <li><span class="cl-a">Added</span> the ability to copy a sector, edge, object, or path link's properties, so they can then be pasted elsewhere.</li>

          <li><span class="cl-c">Changed</span> the unsaved changes warning to be a dialog like in most programs. The idea of the old pop-up was to require fewer clicks and mouse movement when you were sure you wanted to not save, but some actions are hidden behind menus which forces you to go there twice. The dialog approach comes with many quality-of-life tweaks that make it an overall better feature.</li>
          <li><span class="cl-c">Changed</span> the way copying textures from a different sector works. Instead of selecting the source, then hovering the mouse over the destination and pressing T, you now copy the source sector's properties, then paste just the texture on the selected sectors.</li>
          <li><span class="cl-c">Changed</span> what happens when the user is drawing a new sector and clicks on an edge or vertex. Instead of throwing an error, the editor now changes the drawing to a sector split drawing, and lets the user continue drawing from the opposite end.</li>
          <li><span class="cl-c">Changed</span> the area editor's saving procedure to no longer need to boot the user back to the main panel.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Others:
        <ul>
          <li><span class="cl-a">Added</span> the <code>hud</code> <a href="maker_toolkit.html">maker tool</a>.</li>
          <li><span class="cl-a">Added</span> the <code>path_info</code> <a href="maker_toolkit.html">maker tool</a>.</li>
          <li><span class="cl-a">Added</span> the <code>custom_carry_spots</code> property to <a href="mob_type.html">mob types</a>.</li>
          <li><span class="cl-a">Added</span> the <code>power_goal</code> script variable to <a href="mob_group_task.html">group tasks</a>.</li>
          <li><span class="cl-a">Added</span> the <code>goal_number</code> script variable to <a href="mob_scale.html">scales</a>.</li>
          <li><span class="cl-a">Added</span> the <code>stay</code> value to a <a href="mob_resource.html">resource type's</a> delivery results.</li>
          <li><span class="cl-a">Added</span> the <code>linked_mob_matching_type</code> value to a <a href="mob_resource.html">resource type's</a> carrying destinations.</li>
          <li><span class="cl-a">Added</span> the <code>area_image_padding</code> property to the <a href="maker_toolkit.html">maker tools</a>.</li>
          <li><span class="cl-a">Added</span> the ability for dead enemies to drop objects via a "stored inside" feature in the area editor. This allows the engine to detect things like treasures inside enemies for the purposes of missions.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p><b>Breaking changes</b></p>

    <ul>
      <li><span class="cl-r">Removed</span> the ability for dead enemies to drop objects via the <code>spoils</code> and <code>random_pellet_spoils</code> script variables, in favor of the "stored inside" area editor feature. Areas with such objects need to be adjusted.</li>
      <li><span class="cl-c">Changed</span> the following obstacles to have a consistent 192px size: electrical wire (also now doesn't push), paper bag (also now blocks paths), cardboard box, wood bridge.</li>
      <li><span class="cl-c">Changed</span> the spritesheet for player input icons (formerly control icons). All properties and files changed from <code>control_icon</code> to <code>player_input_icon</code>.</li>
      <li><span class="cl-c">Changed</span> the <code>show_hud_controls</code> option to <code>show_hud_input_icons</code>.</li>
      <li><span class="cl-c">Changed</span> the gameplay GUI item names that had <code>button</code> in them to instead have <code>input</code>.</li>
      <li><span class="cl-c">Changed</span> the default value of an <a href="mob_type.html">object type</a>'s <code>can_walk_on_others</code> properties to false.</li>
