Pikmin throw times in Pikmin 2
    Red, Blue, White: 1.3
    Yellow: 1.6
    Purple: 1.8
    
To optimize the leaf shadow textures, do the following:
    1) Convert it to black and white (Pikmin 2's are a bit blueish, but b+w works best for the engine).
    2) Apply an alpha mask of itself (inverted) onto itself. This makes the light areas transparent, and the dark ones opaque.
    3) Set the brightness to 0% (-100 in Paint.NET), and the contrast to 150% (50 in Paint.NET).
    4) Set the opacity of the whole thing to 75% (192 in Paint.NET).
    Ideally, you want the areas fully shrouded in shade to be close to RGBA 0 0 0 128, and the light areas should be fully transparent (0 alpha). Tweak the brightness on step 3 and the opacity on step 4 until you get these values.
    
Things to do at every release
    Check if the Error log reports any errors
    Compile in release build
    
Ideas for the Onion screen
    -When you enter the menu, pause the game and show the menu
    -Pressing move up and move down works as usual
    -Holding or clicking the "all" button (a new button) activates or toggles the all Onion mode, a la P3
    -Holding a new button moves in intervals of 5
    -Whistle button always cancels
    -If using the mouse, you need to press cancel or ok, on-screen
    -Each Onion has +- buttons on-screen
    -An "all" button should be on-screen too
    -The "all" button should only appear with 2+ Onions
    
Ideas on what the engine should do at boot
    -Lists installed games, but if there's only one, it gets picked automatically
    -If there is more than 1 game, show them all, sorted with the most recent picks
    -If there are none, have a brief screen explaining what the engine does and what to do
    -Upon entering a game, open the copyright screen, while loading
    -Once the loading is done, enter the title screen for the game
    -If this is the first time using the engine, stay on the copyright screen for 10 seconds
    -Title screen should have the engine's logo on the corner, with the version number for the engine, and version number for the game
    -Options:
        -Story mode
        -Battle
        -Challenge
        -Options
        -Quit

Candidate for new carrying code (December 2014):
    -When a Pikmin is added to the carriers
        -If the strength is enough
            -Calculate destination
            -Save destination and never change it
    -When a Pikmin is removed from the carriers
        -If the strength is now not enough
            -Stop carrying
            
paralel_loading class idea:
    -One attribute is a pointer to the code of the loading thread
        -It takes as an argument the pointer to the class instance
    -An attribute should store the percentage done
    -The main thread should wait until this attribute reaches 100%, preferably on the logic loop

2 player menu
    -Level, character, and player amount select
    -Rules button
        -Number of enemy marble captures needed to win (0 = no marbles; in 3/4 player mode, any stolen player drops out)
        -Number of yellow marble captures needed to win (0 = no yellow marbles)
        -Time limit (upon reaching 0, the player with the most Pikmin at the end wins, or other tie-breaker attributes; 0 = no time limit)
        -Number of initial Pikmin for each player
        -Number of initial sprays for each player
        -Number of leaders for each player
        -Can you win by Pikmin extinction? (If not, the Onion will always spit out one seed upon would-be extinction)
        -Can you win via leader KO? (If not, leaders don't take damage)
        -Are there any cherries?
        -Is there a bingo card?
        -Should Pikmin that die to opposing Pikmin respawn at the Onion?

Challenge Mode
    -Levels have enemies and treasures
    -When you deliver an enemy, you get Pikmin and Pokos, unless the level specifies that you can't get Pikmin this way
    -There's a time limit
    -There are several categories, and each one has a bronze, silver, gold and platinum level
        -Number of Pikmin deaths
        -Number of Pikmin raised
        -Time spent to clear the level
        -Dead enemies
        -Pokos won (including enemies)
    -The record for each category is saved independently
